"Automated interpretation of the coronary angioscopy with deep convolutional neural networks","Background Coronary angioscopy CAS is a useful modality to assess atherosclerotic changes, but interpretation of the images requires expert knowledge. Deep convolutional neural networks DCNN can be used for diagnostic prediction and image synthesis.Methods 107 images from 47 patients, who underwent coronary angioscopy in our hospital between 2014 and 2017, and 864 images, selected from 142 MEDLINE-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2019, were analyzed. First, we developed a prediction model for the angioscopic findings. Next, we made a generative adversarial networks GAN model to simulate the CAS images. Finall,y we tried to control the output images according to the angioscopic findings with conditional GAN architecture.Results For both yellow color YC grade and neointimal coverage NC grade, we could observe strong correlations between the true grades and the predicted values YC grade, average r value  0.80  0.02, p-value 0.001 NC grade, average r value  0.73  0.02, p  0.001. The binary classification model for the red thrombus yielded 0.71  0.03 F1- score and the area under the ROC curve AUC was 0.91  0.02. The standard GAN model could generate realistic CAS images average Inception score  3.57  0.06. GAN-based data augmentation improved the performance of the prediction models. In the conditional GAN model, there were significant correlations between given values and experts diagnosis in YC grade but not in NC grade.Conclusion DCNN is useful in both predictive and generative modeling that can help develop the diagnostic support system for CAS.","/content/10.1101/19001693v3","/content/10.1101/19001693v3.full.pdf",20200108,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Miyoshi","/highwire/citation/71060/bibtext",2,"090120-2","09/01/2020",71060
"Effects of a Mediterranean Diet and physical activity on atherothrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals","Objective. Following a Mediterranean diet MedDiet and being physically active decrease cardiovascular risk. However, their individual and combined effects on atherothrombosis biomarkers are unexplored. Approach and Results. In 358 random volunteers from the PREDIMED trial Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea, we assessed the 1-year effects of an intervention with MedDiet, enriched with virgin olive oil MedDiet-VOO N120 or nuts MedDiet-Nuts N119 versus a low-fat control diet N119, on atherothrombosis markers. In a secondar,y observational approach, we studied the associations of 1-year changes in MedDiet adherence, physical activity PA levels, and their combination, with 1-year differences in atherothrombosis biomarkers. The MedDiet-VOO intervention increased HDL platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase activity by 8.2 95 CI 0.92 15.6 and decreased HDL-bound a1-antitrypsin levels by 5.8 95 CI -11.6 -0.046 versus control diet. The MedDiet-Nuts intervention reduced non-esterified fatty acid levels by 9.1 95 CI -18.0 -0.19 relative to control. Only the low-fat diet was associated with increases in platelet factor-4 and prothrombin factor 12 concentrations versus baseline P0.012 and P0.003, respectively. Increments in MedDiet adherence 1 point were associated with lower fibrinogen levels -1.8, 95 CI -3.38 -0.17. Increases in PA 100 METs.min/d were linked to lower prothrombin factor12 -5.2, 95 CI -10.4 -0.077 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 concentrations -3.0, 95 CI -5.93 -0.12. Finall,y 1-point increments in MedDiet adherence plus 100 METs.min/d of PA were related to lower D-dimer levels -1.52, 95 CI -3.10 0.026 P-interaction0.047.Conclusions. Following a MedDiet and increasing PA were associated with improvements in atherothrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals.","/content/10.1101/19001909v3","/content/10.1101/19001909v3.full.pdf",20200221,"Nutrition","Hernaez","/highwire/citation/72369/bibtext",10,"230220-10","23/02/2020",72369
"Mechanisms of Arrhythmogenicity in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Insight from Noninvasive Electrocardiographic Imaging","Background Mechanisms of arrhythmogenicity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy HCM are not well understood. We hypothesized that HCM is characterized by the specific electrophysiological substrate as compared to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy ICM, or healthy individuals.Methods We conducted a prospective case-control study. The study enrolled HCM patients at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmia VT n10 age 619 y left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF 609, and three comparison groups healthy individuals n10 age 286 y LVEF70, ICM patients with LV hypertrophy LVH and known VT n10 age 649 y LVEF 3115, and ICM patients with LVH and no known VT n10 age 70  7y LVEF 4616. All participants underwent 12-lead ECG, cardiac CT or MRI, and 128-electrode body surface mapping BioSemi ActiveTwo, Netherlands. Non-invasive voltage and activation maps were reconstructed using the open-source SCIRun University of Utah inverse problem-solving environment.Results In the epicardial basal anterior segment, HCM patients had the greatest ventricular activation dispersion 16.45.5 vs. 13.12.7 ICM with VT vs. 13.84.3 ICM no VT vs. 8.12.4 ms Healthy P0.0007, the largest unipolar voltage 1094211 vs. 934189 ICM with VT vs. 898358 ICM no VT vs. 84290 V Healthy P0.023, and the greatest voltage dispersion medianinterquartile range 215161-281 vs. 189143-208 ICM with VT vs. 158109-236 ICM no VT vs. 110106-168V Healthy P0.041.

"High occurrence of transportation and logistics occupations among vascular dementia patients an observational study","BackgroundGrowing evidence suggests a role of occupation in the emergence and manifestation of dementia. Occupations are often defined by complexity level, although working environments and activities differ in several other important ways. We aimed to capture the multi-faceted nature of occupation through its measurement as a qualitative instead of a quantitative variable and explored its relationship with different types of dementia.MethodsWe collected occupational information of 2121 dementia patients with various suspected etiologies from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort age M67, SD8 57 male MMSE M21, SD5. Our final sample included individuals with Alzheimers disease AD dementia n1467, frontotemporal dementia n281, vascular dementia n98, Lewy body disease n174, and progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration n101. Within the AD group, we used neuropsychological data to further characterize patients by clinical phenotypes. All participants were categorized into 1 of 11 occupational classes, across which we evaluated the distribution of dementia subtypes with Chi2 analyses. We gained further insight into occupation-dementia relationships through post hoc logistic regressions that included various demographic and health characteristics as explanatory variables.ResultsThere were significant differences in the distribution of dementia types across occupation groups Chi285.87, p.001. Vascular dementia was relatively common in the Transportation/Logistics sector, and higher vascular risk factors partly explained this relationship. AD occurred less in Transportation/Logistics and more in Health Care/Welfare occupations, which related to a higher/lower percentage of males. We found no relationships between occupational classes and clinical phenotypes of AD Chi253.65, n.s..ConclusionsRelationships between occupation and dementia seem to exist beyond the complexity level, which offers new opportunities for disease prevention and improvement of occupational health policy.","/content/10.1101/19005512v2","/content/10.1101/19005512v2.full.pdf",20200108,"Occupational and Environmental Health","van Loenhoud","/highwire/citation/71061/bibtext",1,"090120-1","09/01/2020",71061

"Psychiatric comorbid disorders of cognition A machine learning approach using 1,159 UK Biobank participants","BackgroundConceptualising comorbidity is complex and the term is used variously. Here, it is the coexistence of two or more diagnoses which might be defined as chronic and, although they may be pathologically related, they may also act independently 1. Of interest here is the comorbidity of common psychiatric disorders and impaired cognition. ObjectivesTo examine whether anxiety and/or depression are important longitudinal predictors of impaired cognition.MethodsUK Biobank participants used at three timepoints n 502,664 baseline, 1st follow-up n 20,257 and 1st imaging study n40,199. Participants with no missing data were 1,159 participants aged 40 to 70 years, 41 female. Machine learning ML was applied and the main outcome measure of reaction time intraindividual variability cognition was used.FindingsUsing the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC curve, the anxiety model achieves the best performance with an Area Under the Curve AUC of 0.68, followed by the depression model with an AUC of 0.64. The cardiovascular and diabetes model, and the demographics model have weaker performance in predicting cognition, with an AUC of 0.60 and 0.57, respectively.ConclusionsOutcomes suggest psychiatric disorders are more important comorbidities of long-term cognitive change than diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and demographic factors. Findings suggest that mental health disorders anxiety and depression may have a deleterious effect on long-term cognition and should be considered as an important comorbid disorder of cognitive decline. Clinical implicationsImportant predictive effects of poor mental health on longitudinal cognitive decline should be considered in primary care.","/content/10.1101/19006189v2","/content/10.1101/19006189v2.full.pdf",20200302,"Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology","Li","/highwire/citation/72885/bibtext",2,"030320-2","03/03/2020",72885
"Violin plot data A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity classified using laboratory measured valve motion","ObjectivesWe hypothesize that prosthetic valve thrombogenic potential may be inferred by valve regional flow velocity. This metric was used to compare two clinical valves and two experimental prototypes. Methods Four our clinical and experimental prototype valve models were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. Regurgitant flow velocity was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate / projected dynamic valve area. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, thrombogenic potential for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as regurgitant flow velocities relative to the control mechanical valve regurgitant flow velocity of -126 m/s. Analysis of the flow velocity data made use of Vioplot R and VISIO software packages to provide split violin plots that represent probability of recurrence of data. Results Thrombogenic potential was made dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and 1.0. Negative thrombogenic potentials arise when transient rebound of valve occluder is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive thrombogenic potentials occur during decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest thrombogenic potential transient of 0.15. A mock-transcatheter aortic valve replacement incorporating by design a trivial paravalvular leak 1.35 ml/s demonstrated a high transient thrombogenic potential of 0.95. Conclusions Our data reveals distinct thrombogenic potential profile differences between valve models. If our study methods are verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to produce advanced devices with significantly reduced thrombogenic potential.","/content/10.1101/19009407v7","/content/10.1101/19009407v7.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","SCOTTEN","/highwire/citation/72630/bibtext",56,"270220-56","27/02/2020",72630
"Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation for refractory scar-related ventricular tachycardia","BackgroundStereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiotherapy that is performed in a single session and focuses high-dose ionizing radiation beams from a collimated radiation source to a small, localized area of the body. Recentl,y stereotactic radiosurgery has been applied to arrhythmias stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation - STAR, with promising results reported in patients with refractor,y scar-related ventricular tachycardia VT, a cohort with known high morbidity and mortality.ObjectiveHerein, we describe our experience with the use of CyberKnife, a frameless image-guided linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery system, in conjunction with CardioPlan, a cardiac specific radiotherapy planning software, to treat patients with scar-related VT, detailing its early and mid- to long-term results.MethodsThis is a pilot, prospective study of patients undergoing STAR for refractory VT. The anatomical target for radioablation was defined based on the clinical VT morpholog,y electroanatomical mapping, and study-specific pre-procedural imaging with cardiac computed tomography. The target volume delineated with the aid of CardioPlan was treated with a prescription radiation dose of 25 Gy delivered in a single fraction by CyberKnife in an outpatient setting. Ventricular arrhythmias and radiation-related adverse events were monitored at follow-up to determine STAR efficacy and safety.ResultFive patients 100  male, 63  12 years old, 80  ischemic cardiomyopath,y left ventricular ejection fraction 34  15  with refractory VT underwent STAR between January and June 2018. Radioablation was delivered in 82  11 minutes without acute complications. During a mean follow-up of 12  2 months, all patients experienced clinically significant mid- to late-term ventricular arrhythmia recurrence two patients died of complications associated with their advanced heart failure. There were no clinical or imaging evidence of radiation necrosis or other radiation-induced complications in the organs at risk surrounding the scar targeted by radioablation.ConclusionDespite good initial results, STAR did not result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in a selected, high-risk population of patients with scar-related VT. The safety profile was confirmed to be favorable, with no radiation-related complications observed during follow-up. Further studies are needed to explain these disappointing results.","/content/10.1101/19012880v2","/content/10.1101/19012880v2.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Gianni","/highwire/citation/72533/bibtext",4,"270220-4","27/02/2020",72533
"A novel art of continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurement","Wearable sensors to continuously measure blood pressure BP and derived cardiovascular variables have the potential to revolutionize patient monitoring. Current wearable methods analyzing time components e.g., pulse transit time still lack clinical accurac,y whereas existing technologies for direct BP measurement are too bulky. Here we present a new art of continuous non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring CNAP2GO. It directly measures BP by using a new volume control technique and could be used for small wearable sensors integrated in a finger ring. As a software prototype, CNAP2GO showed excellent BP measurement performance in comparison with invasive BP in 46 patients having surgery. The resulting pulsatile BP signal carries information to derive cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables. We show that CNAP2GO can be miniaturized for wearable approaches. CNAP2GO potentially constitutes the breakthrough for wearable sensors for blood pressure and flow monitoring in both ambulatory and in-hospital clinical settings.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938v2","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938v2.full.pdf",20200107,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Fortin","/highwire/citation/71056/bibtext",1,"080120-1","08/01/2020",71056
"A Preoperative Estimate of Central Venous Pressure Is Associated with Early Fontan Failure","Objective Early Fontan Failure EFF is a serious complication following total cavopulmonary connection TCPC, characterised by high central venous pressure CVP, low cardiac output and resistance to medical therapy. This study aimed to estimate post-operative CVP in TCPC patients CVPTCPC using data routinely collected during pre-operative assessment. We sought to determine if this metric correlated with measured post-operative CVP and if it was associated with EFF.Methods In this retrospective stud,y CVPTCPC was estimated in 131 patients undergoing pre-TCPC assessment by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and CVP measurement under general anaesthesia. Post-operative CVP during the first 24hours in ICU was collected from electronic patient records in a subset of patients. EFF was defined as death, transplantation, TCPC takedown or emergency fenestration within the first 30days.ResultsEstimated CVPTCPC correlated significantly with CVPICU r0.26, p0.03, particularly in patients without a fenestration r0.45, p0.01. CVPTCPC was significantly associated with EFF Odds Ratio OR 1.12 1.02-1.24, p0.02. A threshold of CVPTCPC  33mmHg was found to have the highest specificity 90 and sensitivity 67 for identifying EFF area under receiver operating curve, AUC  0.79, OR 18.8 3.1-114, p0.001. This association was stronger in patients with single SVCs.ConclusionsEstimated CVPTCPC is an easily calculated metric combining pre-operative pressure and flow data. Higher CVPTCPC is associated with an increased risk of EFF and is correlated with directly measured post-TCPC pressure. Identification of patients at risk of EFF has the potential to guide risk mitigation strategies.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016048v1","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016048v1.full.pdf",20200102,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Quail","/highwire/citation/70954/bibtext",13,"030120-13","03/01/2020",70954
"The role of Body Mass Index in high and low velocity trauma causing knee injury associated to popliteal artery lesions.","Background Osteoarticular traumas are particularly dangerous among arterial traumas, those associated with the popliteal artery are associated with a high amputation rate. Despite representing a minority of arterial traumas, with an incidence that considerably varies by population and geographic location, traumatic lesions of the popliteal artery are a challenge. This study aimed to verify the impact of BMI on arterial trauma damage and outcome.Methods Data were retrospectively collected from the emergency and operating rooms electronic medical reports at  our Institution between 1 January 2005 and 1 May 2018 of all osteoarticular and vascular associated lesion. 41 pts presented with lower limb arterial trauma 43.2, and popliteal artery lesions occurred in 11 26.8. 11 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. In addition, the lesion mechanism was dislocation by high-velocity trauma in 9 cases and by low-velocity trauma in 3. All 7 males 63.6 were affected by high-velocity trauma, and 2 of the 3 females by low-velocity trauma. Only one patient had an isolated popliteal artery lesion associated with fractures in the leg or in contralateral limb. Patients with low-velocity traumas were older than 54 years while those with high-velocity were aged from 22 to 71 years.Results The lesion mechanism was dislocation due to high-velocity trauma in eight patients and due to low-velocity trauma in three. In 10/11 patients 90.9  revascularization was performed after osteoarticular stabilization. after reduction of the dislocation or fracture. Intraoperative angiography was selectively used. Two patients required above-knee amputation after the procedure one due to infection of the surgical access and the other due to severe soft tissue injury. One patient died during hospitalization due to trauma-related complications and comorbidities.Conclusions Revascularization success is not associated with high- or low-velocity traumas. Furthermore, unlike high-velocity traumas, low-velocity traumas are associated with a body mass index 35kg/m2.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19015966v1","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19015966v1.full.pdf",20200103,"Primary Care Research","Ascoli Marchetti","/highwire/citation/70996/bibtext",5,"040120-5","04/01/2020",70996
"Cardiac Microstructural Abnormalities Identify Women at Risk of Incident Heart Failure","Background Incidence of congestive heart failure is difficult to predict by standard methods. We have developed a method called the signal intensity coefficient that uses echocardiographic texture analysis to quantify microstructural changes which may occur in at-risk patients prior to development of a clinical heart failure syndrome.Methods Participants from the Framingham Offspring Cohort study who attended the 8th visit and received screening echocardiography were included. Participants were followed for a mean of 7.4 years for incident congestive heart failure. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the hazard ratio of signal intensity coefficient in the top quartile of values versus other quartiles in the total and sex-stratified population.Results 2511 participants with interpretable echocardiography and no history of congestive heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction were included in this study. The top quartile signal intensity coefficient had a hazard ratio of 1.83 p0.0048 for incident heart failure. When additional clinical risk factors were added to the model, this became non-significant. Within women, an elevated hazard ratio was significant in multiple models including age and hypertensive medication use. Models were not significant in men.Conclusions Elevated signal intensity coefficient is associated with an increased risk of incident congestive heart failure. This trend remains significant in women after inclusion of age and hypertensive medication use. The signal intensity coefficient may be able to identify patients at risk of developing congestive heart failure using echocardiographic texture analysis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016477v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016477v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Kwan","/highwire/citation/71080/bibtext",24,"110120-24","11/01/2020",71080
"A Computational Approach for Exploring Herbal Inhibitors of Acetylcholinesterase in Alzheimers Disease","Alzheimers disease AD is the most common type of age related dementia. Many hypotheses shed light on several reasons that lead to AD development. The cholinergic hypothesis describes that destruction of an essential neurotransmitter, acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase AChE enzyme, leads to the AD onset. The hydrolysis of acetylcholine by excess amount of AChE decreases the amount of acetylcholine in the brain, thus interfering with the normal brain functions. Many anti- AChE agents can be used to treat AD by targeting AChE. In our stud,y 14 anti- AChE agents from plants 1,8-cineol, berberine, carvacrol, cheilanthifoline, coptisine, estragole, harmaline, harmine, liriodenine, myrtenal, naringenin, protopine, scoulerine, stylopine were tested against AChE and compared with two controls donepezil and galantamine, using different techniques of molecular docking. Molecular docking study was conducted for all the 14 selected ligands against AChE to identify the best three ligands among them. To determine the safety and efficacy of the three best ligands, a set of tests the druglikeness property test, ADME/T test, PASS & P450 site of metabolism prediction, pharmacophore mapping and modelling and DFT calculations were performed. In our experiment, berberine, coptisine and naringenin were determined as the three ligands from the docking study. Further analysis of these 3 ligands showed coptisine as the most potent anti-AChE agent. The molecular dynamics simulation study showed quite results for the coptisine- AChE docked comple.x Administration of berberine, coptisine and naringenin could be potential treatments for AD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016535v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016535v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Pharmacology and Therapeutics","Sarkar","/highwire/citation/71085/bibtext",23,"110120-23","11/01/2020",71085

Setting A secondary mental health care service consisting of four boroughs in South London.Participants A diverse sample of 13,888 psychiatric patients extracted from South London and Maudsley electronic health records database and 3,920 control participants extracted from National Health and Nutrition Survey 2015-2016 were included in the study.Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary NLR levels in patients with mental health diagnoses, NLR between patients with different mental health diagnoses. Secondary Relationship of NLR to length of hospitalisation and to mortality.Results NLR was elevated compared to controls in patients with diagnoses including dementia, alcohol dependence, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depression, non-phobic anxiety disorders, and mild mental retardation p  0.05. NLR also correlated with age, antipsychotic use and hypnotic use. NLR was found to be higher in individuals of White ethnicity and lower in individuals of Black ethnicity. Elevated NLR was associated with increased mortality   0.103, p  2.9e-08 but not with hospital admissions or face-to-face contacts.Conclusions Elevated NLR may reflect a transdiagnostic pathological process occurring in a subpopulation of psychiatric patients.

"A blood miRNA signature associates with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease diagnosis and rate of progression","Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease sCJD presents as a rapidly progressive dementia which is usually fatal within six months. No blood tests are currently available for diagnosis or disease monitoring. Here, we profile blood microRNA miRNA expression in sCJD. Small RNA-sequencing of 57 sCJD patients and 50 healthy controls reveals differential expression of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, hsa-miR-106b-3p and hsa-let-7d-3p. Downregulation of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p and hsa-miR-93-5p in sCJD replicates in an independent cohort using quantitative PCR, with concomitant upregulation of four of their mRNA targets. This miRNA signature discriminates patients with sCJD from Alzheimers disease patients. Finall,y longitudinal monitoring of 15 sCJD patients shows that the rate of decline in miRNA expression significantly correlates with rate of disease progression. These findings highlight novel molecular alterations in human prion disease outside the central nervous system which can provide information about diagnosis, disease progression, and improve mechanistic understanding of sCJD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.19015214v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.19015214v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Neurology","Norsworthy","/highwire/citation/71077/bibtext",28,"110120-28","11/01/2020",71077

Cardiovascular disease and cardiac dysfunction can remain asymptomatic for many years, but eventually lead to progressive disease with high morbidity and mortality. Early detection and intervention are therefore crucial to improve outcome. In our stud,y we aim to 1 assess the prevalence of early cardiac dysfunction in adult childhood cancer survivors using conventional and speckle tracking echocardiograph,y 2 determine the association between cardiac dysfunction and treatment-related risk factors anthracyclines, alkylating agents, steroids, cardiac radiation and modifiable cardiovascular risk factors abdominal obesit,y hypertension, 3 investigate the development of cardiac dysfunction longitudinally in a defined cohort, 4 study the association between cardiac dysfunction and other health outcomes like pulmonar,y endocrine, and renal diseases, quality of life, fatigue, strength and endurance, and physical activit,y and 5 gain experience conducting a clinical study of childhood cancer survivors that will be extended to a national, multicenter study of cardiac complications.Methods We will invite 5 year childhood cancer survivors who were treated at the University Childrens Hospital Bern, Switzerland with any chemotherapy and/or cardiac radiation since 1976 and who are 18 years of age at time of study for a cardiac assessment at the University Hospital Bern. This includes overall 544 childhood cancer survivors, of whom about half were treated with anthracyclines and/or cardiac radiation and half with any other chemotherapy. The standardized cardiac assessment includes a medical history focusing on signs of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, a physical examination, anthropometr,y vital parameters, the 1-minute sit-to-stand test, and an echocardiography including speckle tracking. Results We will invite 544 eligible childhood cancer survivors for a cardiac assessment with a median age at study of 32.5 years and a median times since diagnosis of 25.0 years. Three hundred survivors 55 are at high risk and 244 survivors 45 are at standard risk for cardiac dysfunction. Discussion The results of this study will show the prevalence of early cardiac dysfunction in Swiss childhood cancer survivors, inform whether speckle tracking echocardiography is more sensitive to cardiac dysfunction than conventional echocardiograph,y and give a detailed picture of risk factors for cardiac dysfunction. The results will help improve primary treatment and follow-up care of children suffering from cancer.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017152v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017152v1.full.pdf",20200116,"Oncology","Schindera","/highwire/citation/71204/bibtext",21,"170120-21","17/01/2020",71204
"Ideal Cardiovascular Health in Urban Jamaica Prevalence Estimates and Relationship to Community Property Value, Household Assets and Educational Attainment","BACKGROUND Ideal cardiovascular health ICH is associated with greater longevity and reduced morbidit,y but no research on ICH has been conducted in Jamaica. We estimated the prevalence of ICH in urban Jamaica and evaluated associations between ICH and communit,y household and individual socioeconomic status SES.  METHODS Cross-sectional study using data from 360 men and 665 women, age 20 years   in urban Jamaica. ICH was defined as having seven characteristics current non-smoking, healthy diet, moderate physical activit,y and normal body mass index, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol.  Logistic regression, weighted for survey design, quantified association between the outcome 5 ICH characteristics ICH-5, and exposure variables tertiles of community median land value MLV, tertiles of household assets and educational attainment. RESULTS  Prevalence of ICH 7 characteristics was 0.51, while prevalence of ICH-5 was 22.9 male 24.5, female 21.5, p0.447. In sex-specific multivariable models adjusted for age, education, and household assets, men in the lower tertiles of community MLV had lower odds of ICH-5 compared to men in the upper tertile lowest tertile OR 0.33, 95CI 0.12-0.91, p0.032 middle tertile  OR 0.46 0.20-1.04 p0.062. Women from communities in the lower and middle tertiles of MLV also had lower odds of ICH-5, but association was not statistically significant. Educational attainment was inversely associated with ICH-5 among men and positively associated among women. No significant association was seen for household assets.CONCLUSION Prevalence of ICH is low in urban Jamaica. Living in poorer communities was associated with lower odds of ICH-5 among men. Higher education was associated with higher odds of ICH-5 among women but lowers odds among men.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.12.20017277v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.12.20017277v1.full.pdf",20200116,"Epidemiology","McKenzie","/highwire/citation/71263/bibtext",3,"170120-3","17/01/2020",71263
"Prognostic Imaging Biomarkers for Diabetic Kidney Disease iBEAt Study protocol","Diabetic kidney disease DKD is traditionally classified based on albuminuria and reduced kidney function estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR, but these have limitations as prognostic biomarkers due to the heterogeneity of DKD. Novel prognostic markers are needed to improve stratification of patients based on risk of disease progression.  The iBEAT stud,y part of the BEAt-DKD consortium, aims to determine whether renal imaging biomarkers magnetic resonance imaging MRI and ultrasound US provide insight into the pathogenesis and heterogeneity of DKD primary aim, and whether they have potential as prognostic biomarkers in DKD progression secondary aim. iBEAT is a prospective multi-centre observational cohort study recruiting 500 patients with type 2 diabetes T2D and eGFR  30ml/min/1.73m2. At baseline each participant will undergo quantitative renal MRI and US imaging with central processing for MRI images. Blood sampling, urine collection and clinical examinations will be performed and medical history obtained at baseline, and these assessments will be repeated annually for 3 years. Biological samples will be stored in a central laboratory for later biomarker and validation studies. All data will be stored in a central data depository.

"Pleiotropic effects of statins on ischemic heart disease a Mendelian Randomization study in the UK Biobank","Objectives Statins appear to have pleiotropic effects. We examined whether specifically statins, of the major lipid modifiers, operate on ischemic heart disease IHD via testosterone. As a validation, we assessed whether a drug that unexpectedly likely increases IHD also operates via testosterone.Design A sex-specific univariate and multivariable Mendelian randomization studySetting A large, population-based cohort study recruited in the UK from 2006-10, the UK BiobankParticipants 179918 men with 25410 IHD cases and 212080 women with 12511 IHD casesMain Outcome measures Testosterone and IHDResults Of the three lipid modulations considered, statins, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe, only genetically predicted statin use in men affected testosterone -0.26 effect size testosterone per effect size of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 95 confidence interval CI -0.39 to -0.13. The genetically predicted effect of statin use on IHD in men was partially mediated by testosterone odds ratio OR 0.54 per effect size of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 95 confidence interval CI 0.38 to 0.79, compared to OR 0.67, 95 CI 0.38 to 1.02 after allowing for testosterone. The genetically predicted effect of anakinra use also affected testosterone 0.04 per effect size of IL-1Ra, 95 CI 0.02 to 0.06, and increased IHD in men.Conclusions Statins may partially operate via testosterone in men, which may contribute to pleiotropic effects. Anakinra operating testosterone may also explain its unexpected effects.

"Association Between Reduced Handgrip Strength and Commonly Prescribed Medications","Decreased handgrip-strength has become an increasingly important measure of overall health status and fitness. This was a cross-sectional analysis among adult participants in the 2011-2012 NHANES survey. Handgrip-strength was assessed using a digital dynamometer and a standard protocol, and medication use was assessed by self-report and verification by the interviewer. Mean handgrip-strength among participants with no medication use was 87.2kg in males and 57.2kg in females. Handgrip strength decreased significantly in both men and women ptrend0.001 for both with increasing medication use after adjustment for age, sex, height, arm circumference, and BMI. Statins, ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and sulfonylureas showed a consistent and significant decrease in grip strength in linear regression models. In this nationally representative survey of adults in the US, we observed a negative relationship between handgrip strength and polypharmacy. Further, several specific medications, mostly cardiovascular drug classes, were associated with reduced handgrip-strength.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017087v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017087v1.full.pdf",20200116,"Pharmacology and Therapeutics","Love","/highwire/citation/71225/bibtext",18,"170120-18","17/01/2020",71225
"Cerebrospinal fluid p-tau217 performs better than p-tau181 as a biomarker of Alzheimerrs disease","Cerebrospinal fluid CSF p-tau181 tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 is an established biomarker of Alzheimerrs disease AD reflecting abnormal tau metabolism in the brain. Tau can be phosphorylated at multiple other sites including threonine 217, and here we investigated the performance of CSF p-tau217 as a biomarker of AD in comparison to p-tau181. In the Swedish BioFINDER cohort n194, p-tau217 had stronger correlations with the tau PET tracer 18Fflortaucipir, and more accurately identified individuals with abnormally increased 18Fflortaucipir retention. Furthermore, longitudinal increases in p-tau217 were higher compared to p-tau181 and better correlated with 18Fflortaucipir retention. P-tau217 correlated better than p-tau181 with PET measures of neocortical amyloid- burden and more accurately distinguished AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. Higher correlations between p-tau217 and 18Fflortaucipir were corroborated in an independent EXPEDITION3 trial cohort n32. These findings suggest that p-tau217 might be more useful than p-tau181 in the diagnostic work up of AD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017236v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017236v1.full.pdf",20200116,"Neurology","Janelidze","/highwire/citation/71240/bibtext",12,"170120-12","17/01/2020",71240
"E-Cigarette Use and Subclinical Cardiac Effects","BACKGROUND. Electronic e- cigarettes are marketed as a safer alternative to conventional tobacco cigarettes. Although e-cigarettes contain a lower level of nicotine, the delivery method involves delivering an aerosolized bolus of poorly-characterized ultrafine particles that have unknown cardiovascular effects. METHODS. We studied apparently adult volunteers, free of any chronic disease, including non-smoking controls, chronic e-cigarette users, and chronic tobacco cigarette smokers. After overnight abstinence, we used myocardial contrast echocardiography to measure acute increases in myocardial blood flow MBFinduced by ischemic rhythmic handgrip stress, which causes sympathetically-mediated increases in myocardial work and oxygen demand and, in turn, shear stress, nitric oxide production, and coronary endothelial-dependent vasodilation.RESULTS. In non-smoking controls, handgrip stress increased myocardial blood flow, reflecting normal endothelial function. Chronic tobacco cigarette smokers demonstrated stress-induced blunting in myocardial blood flow change, when compared to non-smoking controls. Chronic e-cigarette smokers demonstrated a decrease, rather than increase, in myocardial blood flow change.CONCLUSION. Chronic e-cigarette users demonstrated substantially impaired coronary microvascular endothelial function, even more pronounced than that seen in chronic tobacco cigarette users. These findings suggest that chronic e-cigarette use leads to measurable and persistent adverse vascular effects that are not directly related to nicotine.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017780v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017780v1.full.pdf",20200118,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Rader","/highwire/citation/71303/bibtext",4,"190120-4","19/01/2020",71303

"Classification and prediction of frontotemporal dementia based on plasma microRNAs","Frontotemporal dementia FTD is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atroph,y typically manifesting with behavioural or language impairment. Because of its heterogeneity and lack of available diagnostic laboratory tests there can be a substantial delay in diagnosis. Cell-free, circulating, microRNAs are increasingly investigated as biomarkers for neurodegeneration, but their value in FTD is not yet established.  In this stud,y we investigate microRNAs as biomarkers for FTD diagnosis. We performed next generation small RNA sequencing on cell-free plasma from 52 FTD cases and 21 controls.  The analysis revealed the diagnostic importance of 20 circulating endogenous miRNAs in distinguishing FTD cases from controls. The study was repeated in an independent second cohort of 117 FTD cases and 35 controls. The combinatorial microRNA signature from the first cohort, precisely diagnosed FTD samples in a second cohort. To further increase the generalizability of the prediction, we implemented machine learning techniques in a merged dataset of the two cohorts, which resulted in a comparable or improved classification precision with a smaller panel of miRNA classifiers. In addition, there are intriguing molecular commonalities with cell free miRNA signature in ALS, a motor neuron disease that resides on a pathological continuum with FTD. However, the signature that describes the ALS-FTD spectrum is not shared with blood miRNA profiles of patients with multiple sclerosis. Thus, microRNAs are promising FTD biomarkers that might enable earlier detection of FTD and improve accurate identification of patients for clinical trials","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v2","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v2.full.pdf",20200128,"Neurology","Magen","/highwire/citation/71563/bibtext",1,"290120-1","29/01/2020",71563

"Feasibility of estimation of aortic wave intensity using non-invasive pressure recordings in the absence of flow velocity in man.","Background Wave intensity analysis provides valuable information on ventriculo-arterial function, hemodynamics and energy transfer in the arterial circulation. Widespread use of wave intensity analysis is limited by the need for concurrent measurement of pressure and flow waveforms. We describe a method that can estimate wave intensity patterns using only non-invasive pressure waveforms, and its reproducibility.Methods Radial artery pressure and left ventricular outflow tract LVOT flow velocity waveforms were recorded in 12 participants in the Southall and Brent Revisited SABRE study. Pressure waveforms were analysed using custom-written software to derive the excess pressure Pxs which was compared with the LVOT flow velocity waveform, and used to calculate wave intensity. In a separate stud,y repeat measures of wave intensity and other wave and reservoir parameters were performed on 34 individuals who attended 2 clinic visits at an interval of approximately 1 month to assess reproducibility and reliability of the method.Results Pxs waveforms were similar in shape to aortic flow velocity waveforms and the time of peak Pxs and maximum aortic velocity agreed closely mean difference  0.00 limits of agreement -0.02, 0.02s. Wave intensity patterns when scaled to peak LVOT velocity gave credible estimates of wave intensity similar to values reported previously in the literature. The method showed fair to good reproducibility for most parameters.Conclusions The Pxs is a surrogate of LVOT flow velocity allowing estimation of aortic wave intensity with acceptable reproducibility. This enables widespread application of wave intensity analysis to large studies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018457v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018457v1.full.pdf",20200124,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Hughes","/highwire/citation/71376/bibtext",5,"250120-5","25/01/2020",71376

"A Pilot Study of an Esophageal Cooling Device During Radiofrequency Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation","Background Esophageal thermal injury is a risk of ablation of the posterior left atrium despite various devices utilized to date.  Objective Evaluate the potential of a commercially-available esophageal cooling device to provide esophageal protection during left atrial catheter ablation. Methods In this pilot stud,y we randomized 6 patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.  Three patients received standard of care for our site use of a single-sensor temperature probe, with adjunct iced-water instillation for any temperature increases 1C.  Three patients received standard ablation after placement of the esophageal cooling device using a circulating water temperature of 4C.  All patients underwent transesophageal echocardiogram TEE and esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD on the day prior to ablation followed by EGD on the day after. Results In the 3 control patients, one had no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, one had diffuse sloughing of the esophageal mucosa and multiple ulcerations, and one had a superficial ulcer with large clot.  Both patients with lesions were classified as Zargar 2a.  In the 3 patients treated with the cooling device, one had no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, one had esophageal erythema Zargar 1, and one had a solitary Zargar 2a lesion.

"Preservation of cognition in hypertension-treated South Indian rural population","Change in diet life style and increased life expectancy has led to the dramatic escalation in old age related complication like cognitive decline leading to dementia. Cardiovascular diseases CVD are huge risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer disease AD. Hypertension is very well known to cause cognitive impairment.  Control of CVD could provide protection against dementia. Earlier in the mouse model of AD, reserpine, an antihypertensive and antipsychotic drug could elicit improvement in the working memory in AD model mice and enhance the same in normal mice. Hence, Cognitive protection in the patients on chronic antihypertensive drug which contains reserpine was evaluated. Cognition in a cohort in the South Indian rural population of hypertensive patients majority age group 50 to 70 years who have been chronically treated with a combinatorial drugadelphane/adelphane esidrexsodl by Novaritis Switzerland consisting of reserpine and hydrazine for years was compared with controls without hypertension. The cohorts were age sex socio-economic education background matched. Cognition was scored using the Tamil version of Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination-III ACEIII Tamil and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tamil scales.  The composite ACEIII Tamil score of control and treated groups were 53.6 and   53.2 respectively. MoCAtamil scores Control 15.1 and Treated 14.7 did not show much alteration. Further the mean scores of the control and treated groups individual components of cognition in ACE, namely Attention Memory Fluency Language and visuospatial cognitive skills also did not reveal significant difference.

"A Precision Medicine Framework for Personalized Simulation of Hemodynamics in Cerebrovascular Disease","IntroductionCerebrovascular disease is a major public health challenge. An important biomarker is cerebral hemodynamics. To measure cerebral hemodynamics, however, only invasive, potentially harmful or time-to-treatment prolonging methods are available. We present a simulation-based alternative which allows calculation of cerebral hemodynamics based on the individual vessel configuration of a patient derived from structural vessel imaging. MethodsWe implemented a framework allowing annotation of extracted brain vessels from structural imaging followed by 0-dimensional lumped modelling of cerebral hemodynamics. For annotation, a 3D-graphical user interface GUI was implemented. For 0D-simulation, we used a modified nodal analysis MNA, which was adapted for easy implementation by code. The code was written in-house in java. The simulation GUI allows inspection of simulation results, identification of vulnerable areas, simulation of changes due to different systemic blood pressures. Moreover, sensitivity analysis was implemented allowing the live simulation of changes of variables such as vessel lumen to simulate procedures and disease courses. In two exemplary patients, simulation results were compared to dynamic-susceptibility-weighted-contrast-enhanced magnetic-resonanceDSC-MR perfusion imaging.ResultsThe successful implementation of the framework allowing individualized annotation and simulation of patients is presented. In two exemplary patients, both the simulation as well as DSC-MRI showed the same results pertaining to the identification of areas vulnerable to ischemia. Sensitivity analysis allows the individualized simulation of changes in vessel lumen and the effect on hemodynamics.DiscussionWe present the first precision medicine pipeline for cerebrovascular disease which allows annotation of the arterial vasculature derived from structural vessel imaging followed by personalized simulation of brain hemodynamics. This paves the way for further development of precision medicine in stroke using novel biomarkers and might make the application of harmful and complex perfusion methods obsolete for certain use cases in the future.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019190v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019190v1.full.pdf",20200129,"Neurology","Frey","/highwire/citation/71606/bibtext",3,"300120-3","30/01/2020",71606
"Developing an Individualized Clinical Prediction Rules of Antihypertensive Drugs A Study Protocol Based on Real-world Practice","Background Hypertension is one of the most urgent public health challenges, and drug therapy is the primary method to control blood pressure for patients. However, blood pressure control rate is still poor with antihypertensive drugs use. Although Clinical Prediction Rules CPR is useful to help clinicians make more appropriate decisions at the point of medication, the evidence is still limited in china. The objective of this study is to develop an CPR of antihypertensive drugs in individualized application of patients based on real-world practice.Methods  A two-way cohort study has been conducted in one Chinas large tertiary hospital using clinical information on patient characteristics, drug use and clinical outcome. Data extraction is through ICD-10 disease codes of hypertension from Electronic Medical Record System. Eligible patients admitted from September 2016 to August 2018 who have received at least one antihypertensive drug therapy is included. Patients were grouped into several exposure groups according to medications. COX regression model and clinical specialty survey is applied to identify Influencing Factors IF in different study groups, and the discriminant model was used to construct a CPR according IF. The accuracy of the CPR is analyzed by sensitivit,y specificit,y Youdens index and Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC curve.Discussion Result is expected to provide valuable CPR for physicians and policymakers with respect to treating hypertension according characteristic of individual patients. By developing a predictive method for clinical outcomes and treatment costs of antihypertensive medication, we expect to discriminate those patients who would profit from specific scheme of antihypertensive drugs to minimal incidence probability of costs and complications in region of china.Trial registration This study was registered at www.chictr.org as a primary register of the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP, and the registered number is ChiCTR1900026339.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019364v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019364v1.full.pdf",20200130,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Hong","/highwire/citation/71634/bibtext",2,"310120-2","31/01/2020",71634
"A genetic model of ivabradine recapitulates results from randomized clinical trials","Background. Naturally occurring human genetic variants provide a valuable tool to identify drug targets and guide drug prioritization and clinical trial design. Ivabradine is a heart rate lowering drug with protective effects on heart failure despite increasing the risk of atrial fibrillation. In patients with coronary artery disease without heart failure, the drug does not protect against major cardiovascular adverse events prompting questions about the ability of genetics to have predicted those effects. This study evaluates the effect of a mutation in HCN4, ivabradines drug target, on safety and efficacy endpoints.Methods. We used genetic association testing and Mendelian randomization to predict the effect of ivabradine and heart rate lowering on cardiovascular outcomes.Results. Using data from the UK Biobank and large GWAS consortia, we evaluated the effect of a heart rate-reducing genetic variant at the HCN4 locus encoding ivabradines drug target. These genetic association analyses showed increases in risk for atrial fibrillation OR 1.09, 95 CI 1.06-1.13, P9.3  10-9 in the UK Biobank. In a cause-specific competing risk model to account for the increased risk of atrial fibrillation, the HCN4 variant reduced incident heart failure in participants that did not develop atrial fibrillation HR 0.90, 95 CI 0.83-0.98, P0.013. In contrast, the same heart rate reducing HCN4 variant did not prevent a composite endpoint of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death OR 0.99, 95 CI 0.93-1.04, P0.61.Conclusion. Genetic modelling of ivabradine recapitulates its benefits in heart failure, promotion of atrial fibrillation, and neutral effect on myocardial infarction.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019521v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019521v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Legault","/highwire/citation/71682/bibtext",27,"040220-27","04/02/2020",71682
"Amyloid-beta CSF/PET discordance vs tau load 5 years later It takes two to tangle","OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between discordant amyloid-A PET and CSF biomarkers at baseline and the emergence of tau pathology 5 years later. METHODS We included 730 ADNI participants without dementia 282 cognitively normal, 448 mild cognitive impairment with baseline 18FFlorbetapir PET and CSF A42 available. Amyloid- CSF/PET status was determined at baseline using established cut-offs. Longitudinal data was available for 18Fflorbetapir A PET baseline to 4.31.9 years, CSF ptau baseline to 2.00.1 years, cognition baseline to 4.32.0 years, and 18Fflortaucipir tau PET measured 5.21.2 years after baseline to 1.60.7 years later. We used linear mixed modelling to study the association between amyloid- CSF/PET status and tau pathology measured in CSF or using PET. Additionall,y we calculated the proportion of CSF/PET- participants who during follow-up i progressed to amyloid- CSF/PET, and/or ii became tau-positive based on 18Fflortaucipir PET. RESULTS Amyloid- CSF/PET N318 participants had elevated CSF ptau levels and worse cognitive performance at baseline, while CSF/PET- N80 participants were overall similar to the CSF-/PET- N306 group. Five years after baseline, 18Fflortaucipir PET uptake in the CSF/PET- group 1.200.13 did not differ from CSF-/PET- 1.180.08, p0.69, but was substantially lower than CSF/PET 1.480.44, p0.001. Of the CSF/PET- subjects, 21/64 33 progressed to amyloid- CSF/PET, whereas only one 3, difference p0.05 became tau-positive based on 18Fflortaucipir PET. CONCLUSIONS Sufficient amyloid- load detectable by both CSF and PET is required before substantial tau deposition emerges. Compared to participants with abnormal amyloid- levels on PET and CSF, the CSF/PET- group has a distinctly better prognosis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019539v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019539v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Neurology","Reimand","/highwire/citation/71681/bibtext",26,"040220-26","04/02/2020",71681
"Collapsing the list of myocardial infarction-related differential expressed genes into a diagnostic signature","Myocardial infarction MI is one of the most severe manifestations of coronary artery disease CAD and the leading cause of death from non-infectious diseases worldwide. It is known that the central component of CAD pathogenesis is a chronic vascular inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying the changes that occur in T, B and NK lymphocytes, monocytes and other immune cells during CAD and MI are still poorly understood. One of those pathogenic mechanisms might be the dysregulation of intracellular signaling pathways in the immune cells. In the present study we performed a transcriptome profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MI patients and controls. The machine learning algorithm was then used to search for MI-associated signatures, that could reflect the dysregulation of intracellular signaling pathways. The genes ADAP2, KLRC1, MIR21, PDGFD and CD14 were identified as the most important signatures for the classification model with L1-norm penalty function. The classifier output quality was equal to 0.911 by Receiver Operating Characteristic metric on test data. These results were validated on two independent open GEO datasets. Identified MI-associated signatures can be further assisted in MI diagnosis and/or prognosis. Thus, our study presents a pipeline for collapsing the list of differential expressed genes, identified by high-throughput techniques, in order to define disease-associated diagnostic signatures.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019554v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019554v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Genetic and Genomic Medicine","Osmak","/highwire/citation/71683/bibtext",25,"040220-25","04/02/2020",71683
"Apolipoprotein E genotype, lifestyle and coronary artery disease gene-environment interaction analyses in the UK Biobank population","Introduction Carriers of the APOE U03F54 genotype have an increased risk for developing coronary artery disease CAD, but there is preliminary evidence that lifestyle factors interact with APOE genotype on CAD risk. Here, we assessed the interactions of physical activit,y oily fish intake and polyunsaturated fatty acid PUFA intake with APOE genotype on risk of incident cardiovascular disease in a large population of middle-aged individuals. Methods The present study was embedded in the UK Biobank population and comprised 344,092 European participants mean age 56.5 years, 45.7 men without a history of CAD. Information regarding physical activit,y oily fish intake and PUFA intake was collected through questionnaires, and information on incident CAD through linkage with hospital admission records. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age and se.x Results A higher physical activity level and a higher intake of oily fish were associated with a lower incidence of CAD. These associations were similar across all APOE isoform groups p-values for interaction  0.05. A higher PUFA intake was only associated with a lower CAD risk in APOE e4 carriers hazard ratio 0.76, 95 confidence interval 0.62,0.90, however, no statistically significant interaction was observed p-valueinteraction  0.137. Conclusion While higher physical activit,y fish intake and PUFA intake all decreased the risk of CAD, no evidence for interaction of these lifestyle factors with APOE genotype was observed in UK Biobank participants. Interventions intended to reduce cardiovascular risk might therefore be similarly effective across the APOE isoform carriers.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019620v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019620v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Bos","/highwire/citation/71699/bibtext",18,"040220-18","04/02/2020",71699
"Deep Learning for pericardial fat extraction and evaluation on a population study","The pericardial fat represents a powerful promising index which has been seen to correlate with several cardiovascular events. We propose a novel approach to automatically measure it from CT scans and we seek to explore how it is distributed in a study population. We studied a population of 1528 patients where 47 3 showed a cardiac event. The fat segmentation model was based on a deep neural network to identify the heart and from it, the pericardial fat was extract by threshold. Statistical analysis was finally computed to stratify the population according the quantity of pericardial fat. The high segmentation quality was reported with a Dice index 92.5 and a Pearson coefficient 0.990, p0.001. Notabl,y normalized pericardial fat volume was significantly higher in patients with cardiac event 73.4630.84 vs 60.0625.38 cm3/m2, p0.005 with a AUC of 63,44 for discrimination of cardiac event.

"Improving Esophageal Protection during AF ablation the IMPACT study.","Background Thermal injury to the esophagus is a known complication of ablation for atrial fibrillation AF and accounts for most procedure-related mortality. Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen by infusing cold liquid can reduce thermal injury to a limited extent. Objective To investigate the ability of a powerful temperature control device to protect the esophagus from ablation-related thermal injury.Methods A single-center, prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial was used to investigate the ability of the ensoETM device to protect the esophagus from thermal injury. This method was compared in a 11 randomization to a control group of standard practice utilizing a single-point temperature probe. In the study group, the device was used to keep the luminal temperature at 4 degrees during radiofrequency RF ablation for AF. Endoscopic examination was performed at 7 days post-ablation and esophageal injury was scored. The patient and the endoscopist were blinded to the randomization.Results We recruited 188 patients, of whom 120 underwent endoscopy. Thermal injury to the mucosa was significantly more common in the control group than in those receiving esophageal protection 12/60 versus 2/60 P0.008, with a trend toward reduction in gastroparesis 6/60 Vs 2/60, p0.27. There was no difference between groups in RF duration, force, power and combined ablation index P value range 0.2-0.9. Procedure duration and fluoroscopy duration were similar P0.97, P0.91 respectively. Conclusion Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen significantly reduces ablation-related thermal injury compared to standard care. This method of esophageal protection is safe and does not compromise the efficacy of the ablation procedure.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019158v2","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019158v2.full.pdf",20200204,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Leung","/highwire/citation/71777/bibtext",18,"060220-18","06/02/2020",71777
"Hemodynamic modeling of aspirin effects on BOLD responses at 7T","Aspirin is considered a potential confound for functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies. This is because aspirin affects the synthesis of prostaglandin, a vasoactive mediator centrally involved in neurovascular coupling, a process that underlies the blood oxygenated level dependent BOLD response. Aspirin-induced changes in BOLD signal are a potential confound for fMRI studies of patients e.g. with cardiovascular conditions or stroke who receive low-dose aspirin prophylactically and are compared to healthy controls that do not take aspirin. To examine the severity of this potential confound, we combined high field 7 Tesla MRI during a simple hand movement task with a biophysically informed hemodynamic model. Comparing elderly volunteers with vs. without aspirin medication, we tested for putative effects of low-dose chronic aspirin on the BOLD response. Specificall,y we fitted hemodynamic models to BOLD signal time courses from 14 regions of the human motor system and examined whether model parameter estimates were significantly altered by aspirin. While our analyses indicate that hemodynamics differed across regions, consistent with the known regional variability of the BOLD response, we neither found a significant main effect of aspirin i.e., an average effect across brain regions nor an expected drugregion interaction. While our sample size is not sufficiently large to rule out small-to-medium global effects of aspirin, we had adequate statistical power for detecting the expected interaction. Altogether, our analysis suggests that low-dose aspirin, as used for prophylactic purposes, does not strongly affect BOLD signals and may not represent a critical confound for fMRI studies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019729v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019729v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Radiology and Imaging","Do","/highwire/citation/71740/bibtext",8,"040220-8","04/02/2020",71740
"Initiation of smoking and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes a mendelian randomization study","Objectives To evaluate the association between smoking behavior and type 2 diabetes risk using genetic data. Research Design and Methods We obtained summary data from genome-wide association studies GWAS related to smoking behavior n1.2 million people and type 2 diabetes n898,130 in individuals of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using these summary-level statistics. Specificall,y we assessed if genetically determined smoking initiation, smoking cessation, and smoking heaviness number of cigarettes per day modulated susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Results We observed that for each 2-fold increased odds of initiating smoking behavior corresponded with a 21 increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes OR  1.21, 95 CI 1.18-1.24, P1x10-12. Our effect was consistent across instrumental variable methodological approaches, and we did not observe evidence of systematic biases to our effect estimate. When analyzed using an analogous approach, we found that the effect of smoking initiation increasing diabetes risk was equivalent to the effect of smoking behavior on increase coronary artery disease, an established causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Conclusions Genetic data supports the hypothesis that smoking initiation corresponds with increased risk for type 2 diabetes. These findings are consistent with previous clinical epidemiological association between smoking behavior and elevated type 2 diabetes risk. Individual-level MR studies are necessary to estimate mediators and confounders related to this association.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019737v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019737v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Genetic and Genomic Medicine","Thom","/highwire/citation/71716/bibtext",13,"040220-13","04/02/2020",71716
"Association of the use of hearing aids with the incidence and progression of dementia A longitudinal retrospective study","Background Hearing aid usage has been linked to improvements in cognition, communication, and socialization, but the extent to which it can affect the onset and progression of dementia is unknown. This study leveraged the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to longitudinally examine the association between the use of hearing aids and risk of progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment MCI to dementia as well as progression of dementia in hearing-impaired adults.MethodsThe sample included 977 participants aged 50 with MCI or all-cause dementia enrolled between 2005 and 2018. Participants were classified into four groups according to the definition of the duration of disease stage Group 1, 450 participants with MCI at baseline that developed dementia during follow up Group 2, 314 participants diagnosed with dementia at baseline and subsequently died during follow-up Group 3, 126 healthy participants who were later diagnosed with MCI and then dementia at follow-up Group 4, 87 participants with MCI at baseline who later converted to dementia and subsequently died during follow-up. Groups 3 and 4 were used to better capture the duration of MCI-to-dementia and dementia-to-death periods. Kaplan-Meier survival functions and survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to assess the effect of hearing aid use on risk of MCI-to-dementia conversion and mortality risk in dementia participants. Sensitivity analyses were performed to control for confounding.ResultsHearing aid users with MCI showed a reduced risk of developing dementia both in Group 1 hazard ratio HR 0.56, 95CI, 0.45-0.69 false discovery rate FDR p .0001 and Group 3 HR,0.42 95CI, 0.27-0.66 FDR p .001.

"Exploring the potential for collaborative use of an app-based platform for n-of-1 trials among healthcare professionals that treat patients with insomnia","Background N-of-1 trials are single patient, multiple crossover, comparative effectiveness experiments. Despite their rating as level 1 evidence, they are not routinely used in clinical medicine to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments.Objective We explored the potential for implementing a mobile app-based n-of-1 trial platform for collaborative use by clinicians and patients to support data-driven decisions around the treatment of insomnia. Methods A survey assessing awareness and utilization of n-of-1 trials was administered to healthcare professionals that frequently treat patients with insomnia at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. 1M electronic health records were analyzed to evaluate evidence for a comorbid relationship between insomnia and dementia or Alzheimers disease among a patient population that may benefit from n-of-1 trials for the selection of optimal sleep treatments.  Results A total of 45 healthcare professionals completed the survey and were included in the analysis. We found that 64 of healthcare professionals surveyed had not heard of n-of-1 trials. After a brief description of these methods, 75 of healthcare professionals reported that they are likely or highly likely to use an app-based n-of-1 trial at least once in the next year if the service were free and easy to offer to their patients.  Conclusions An app-based n-of-1 trials platform might be a valuable tool for clinicians and patients to identify the best treatments for insomnia.

"Microstructural degeneration underlies executive dysfunction after stroke","Objective Executive dysfunction affects 40 of stroke patients and is associated with poor quality of life. Stroke severity and lesion volume rarely predict whether a patient will have executive dysfunction. Stroke typically occurs on a background of cerebrovascular burden, which impacts cognition and brain network structural integrity. We investigated whether measures of white matter microstructural integrity and cerebrovascular risk factors better explain executive dysfunction than markers of stroke severity. Methods We used structural equation modelling to examine multivariate relationships between cerebrovascular risk, white matter microstructural integrity fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivit,y stroke characteristics and executive dysfunction in 126 stroke patients mean age 68.4 years, three months post-stroke, and compared to 40 age- and sex-matched control participants. Executive function was measured using the Trail Making Tests, Clock Drawing task and Rey Complex Figure copy task. Microstructural integrity was estimated using a standard pipeline to process diffusion weighted images. Results Executive function was below what would be expected for age and education level in stroke patients t-test compared to controls t795.75, p0.001. A multivariate structural equation model illustrated the complex relationship between executive function, white matter integrit,y stroke characteristics and cerebrovascular risk. Pearsons correlations confirmed a stronger relationship between executive dysfunction and white matter integrit,y than executive dysfunction and stroke severity. Mediation analysis showed the relationship between executive function and white matter integrity is mediated by cerebrovascular burden. Interpretation White matter microstructural degeneration of the superior longitudinal fasciculus in the executive control network better explains executive dysfunction than markers of stroke severity.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020131v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020131v1.full.pdf",20200204,"Neurology","Veldsman","/highwire/citation/71768/bibtext",27,"060220-27","06/02/2020",71768

"Quantification of positive family history as a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease","Objective There is very little research regarding quantification of family history as a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease. This is especially so in the South Asian population, which tends to suffer from ischaemic heart disease at a much younger age, even after environmental and dietary factors are accounted for. This indicates a likely genetic basis. The aim of this study was to quantify family history as a risk factor.Methods It is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Patients with family history and hypertension as the only cardiac risk factors were recruited in the study along with control subjects. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was used for the detection of myocardial ischemia.Results 114 patients had hypertension and family history as the only risk factors. 64 of these patients had myocardial ischemia. 102 control patients were also recruited, of whom only 26 suffered from myocardial ischemia. The odds-ratio was thus calculated to be 3.69 95 CI 1.54-9.28, p0.001.Conclusions These findings suggest a strong genetic basis for ischemic heart disease in the South Asian population.

"Circular RNA and its mechanisms in diabetic retinopathy a systematic review","Circular RNAs CircRNAs are endogenous long non-coding RNAs. Unlike linear RNAs, they are structurally continuous and covalently closed, without 5 caps or 3 polyadenylation tails. High-throughput RNA sequencing has enabled people to find several endogenous circRNAs in different species and tissues. circRNA mainly acts as a sponge for microRNAs in cytoplasm to regulates protein translation, or interacts with RNA-binding proteins to generate RNA protein complexes that control transcription. circRNAs are closely associated with diseases such as diabetes, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, which indicates that circRNAs are closely related to and also play an important functional role in the occurrence and development of human diseases. Recent studies have shown that they are differentially expressed in healthy and diseased eye tissues. There lacks of biomarkers for early detection of diabetic retinopath,y and the newly discovered circRNAs seem to be an ideal candidate of novel molecular markers and therapeutic targets.

Fatty acid derived eicosanoids serve as mediators of inflammation and have been suggested to also regulate renal vascular tone, peripheral resistance, renin-angiotensin system, and endothelial function. We therefore hypothesize that specific pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids modulate BP.Methods In N8099 FINRISK 2002 cohort participants randomly drawn from the Finnish population register 53 women, mean age 4813 years, we profiled 545 distinct high-quality eicosanoids and related oxylipin mediators in plasma using non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In models adjusted for conventional hypertension risk factors, we analyzed the associations of eicosanoids and eicosanoid profiles with systolic BP and hypertension. We used the Framingham Heart Study FHS Offspring study N2859 as the replication cohort.Results We observed 187 eicosanoids 34 significantly associated with systolic BP P  Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 0.05/545. 175 of these associations were positive and 12 were negative. Due to strong correlations between the eicosanoids, we used forward selection linear regression modeling to identify six eicosanoids independently related to systolic BP. A risk score based on these six eicosanoids was related to 40 95 confidence interval CI, 33-48 and 32 95 CI, 21-44 greater odds of hypertension in FINRISK and FHS, respectivel,y per 1-SD score increase. Individuals in the upper quartile of the six-eicosanoid risk score had 2.26-fold greater odds 95 CI, 1.96-2.62 of prevalent hypertension in FINRISK, compared with those in the lowest quartile. These findings were successfully replicated in an independent cohort of FHS participants.Conclusions Plasma eicosanoids demonstrate strong associations with BP in the general population. Intriguingl,y we observed specific protective molecules as well as harmful molecules. As eicosanoid compounds affect numerous physiological processes that are central to BP regulation, they may offer new insights regarding pathogenesis of hypertension, as well as serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021022v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021022v1.full.pdf",20200211,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Palmu","/highwire/citation/71972/bibtext",12,"170220-12","17/02/2020",71972
"Effect of Respiratory Muscle Training on Dysphagia in Stroke Patients - A Retrospective Pilot Study","Background Dysphagia is prevalent with cerebrovascular accidents and contributes to the burden of disease and mortality. Strengthening of the dysfunctional swallow muscles through respiratory muscle training RMT has proven effective in improving swallow effectiveness and safety. However, approaches to strengthen only the expiratory muscle groups EMST dominate the clinical study literature, with variable outcomes. This study investigated the effect of a simultaneous inspiratory and expiratory muscle strengthening strategy to improve swallowing function in stroke patients. Methods Twenty post-stroke patients were randomly assigned to either intervention group IG or control group CG. The intervention group was treated with three 5-minute sessions of resistive respiratory muscle training every day for 28 days, while the control group received no RMT. Respiratory and swallow outcomes were assessed pre- and post-intervention and included Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability MASA, Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing FEES with Penetration/Aspiration Scale PAS, Functional Oral Intake Scale FOIS, patient visual analogue scale VAS, and peak expiratory flow PEF. Results After 28 days, the intervention group demonstrated greater improvements pVal  0.05 in PEF IG 168.03 vs CG 17.47, VAS IG 103.85 vs CG 27.54, MASA IG 37.28 vs CG 6.92, PAS IG 69.84 vs CG 12.12, and FOIS IG 93.75 vs CG 21.21. Conclusion Combined resistive inspiratory and expiratory muscle training is a feasible and effective method to improve signs and symptoms of dysphagia in stroke patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021303v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021303v1.full.pdf",20200211,"Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy","Arnold","/highwire/citation/72007/bibtext",31,"170220-31","17/02/2020",72007
"Cognitive impairments in sporadic cerebral small vessel disease SVD a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohorts with stroke, dementia and non-clinical presentations of SVD","Background Cognitive impairment is a key clinical feature of cerebral small vessel disease SVD, but the full range of SVD-related cognitive impairments is unclear, and little is known about how they might vary across clinical and non-clinical manifestations of SVD.Methods In systematic searches of OVID MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO from 1st January 1985 to 6th October 2019, we identified studies reporting cognitive test results for study participants with SVD and control participants without SVD. Using standardised group-level cognitive test data, we performed random effects meta-analyses in seven cognitive domains to test whether cognitive test scores differed between SVD and control groups. We conducted meta-regression analyses to test whether differences in age, education, or vascular risk factors between SVD and control groups, or whether different clinical manifestations of SVD e.g. stroke, cognitive impairment, or non-clinical presentations accounted for cognitive effect sizes.Findings Of 8562 studies identified, we included 69 studies from six continents, published in four languages. These studies included 3229 participants with SVD and 3679 controls. Meta-analyses demonstrated that on average, control groups outperformed SVD cohorts on cognitive tests in all cognitive domains examined executive function estimate -0.928 95CI -1.08, -0.78 processing speed -0.885 -1.17, -0.60 delayed memory -0.898 -1.10, -0.69 language -0.808 -1.01, -0.60 visuospatial ability -0.720 -0.96, -0.48 reasoning -0.634 -0.93, -0.34 and attention -0.622 -0.94, -0.31 all p0.001. Meta-regression analyses suggested that differences in years of education between SVD and control groups may account for a proportion of the differences in performance on tests of executive function, visuospatial ability and language, and that cohorts with cognitive impairments performed more poorly on tests of executive function, delayed memory and visuospatial ability than cohorts with stroke or non-clinical presentations of SVD.Interpretation Participants with SVD demonstrated poorer cognitive performance relative to control groups in all cognitive domains we examined. This effect was present for all presentations of SVD, reinforcing the need to test a range of cognitive domains in both clinical and research settings. Lower levels of education in SVD versus control participants may contribute to these effects, highlighting the need to account for educational level in the assessment of SVD-related cognitive impairment.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020628v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020628v1.full.pdf",20200211,"Neurology","Hamilton","/highwire/citation/71963/bibtext",8,"170220-8","17/02/2020",71963
"Transcutaneous Cervical Vagal Nerve Stimulation Blocks Sympathetic Responses to Stress in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder","Objective Exacerbated autonomic responses to acute stress are prevalent in posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of transcutaneous cervical VNS tcVNS on autonomic responses to acute stress in patients with PTSD. The authors hypothesized tcVNS would reduce the sympathetic response to stress compared to a sham device.Methods Using a randomized double-blind approach, the effects of tcVNS on physiological responses to stress were investigated in patients with PTSD n25 using noninvasive sensing modalities. Participants received either sham or active tcVNS after exposure to acute personalized traumatic script stress and mental stress public speech, mental arithmetic over a three-day protocol. Physiological parameters related to sympathetic responses to stress were investigated.Results Relative to sham, tcVNS paired to traumatic script stress decreased sympathetic function as measured by decreased heart rate -5.6  -3.6, p0.01, increased photoplethysmogram amplitude peripheral vasodilation 30.8 -28, p0.05, and increased pulse arrival time vascular function 6.2 -1.9, p0.0001. Similar p  0.05 autonomic, cardiovascular, and vascular effects were observed when tcVNS was applied after mental stress or without acute stress.Conclusion tcVNS attenuates sympathetic arousal associated with stress related to traumatic memories as well as mental stress in patients with PTSD, with effects persisting throughout multiple traumatic stress and stimulation testing days. These findings show that tcVNS has beneficial effects on the underlying neurophysiology of PTSD. Such autonomic metrics may also be evaluated in daily life settings in tandem with tcVNS therapy to provide closed-loop delivery and measure efficacy.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021626v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021626v2.full.pdf",20200217,"Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology","Gurel","/highwire/citation/72123/bibtext",1,"180220-1","18/02/2020",72123
"A non-APOE polygenic score for Alzheimers disease and APOE-e4 have independent associations with dementia in the Health and Retirement Study","INTRODUCTION. Alzheimers disease AD is a common and costly neurodegenerative disorder. A large proportion of risk is heritable and many genetic risk factors for AD have been identified. The cumulative genetic risk of known markers has not been benchmarked for dementia in a population-based sample.METHODS. In the United States population-based Health and Retirement Study HRS waves 1995-2014, we evaluated the role of cumulative genetic risk for AD, with and without the APOE-e4 alleles, on dementia status dementia, cognitive impairment without dementia, borderline cognitive impairment without dementia, cognitively normal. We used logistic regression, accounting for demographic covariates and genetic principal components, and analyses were stratified by European and African genetic ancestry.RESULTS. In the European ancestry sample n8399, both AD polygenic score excluding the APOE genetic region odds ratio OR1.10 95 confidence interval CI 1.00, 1.20 and the presence of any APOE-e4 alleles OR2.42 95 CI 1.99, 2.95 were associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal cognition in a mutually-adjusted model. In the African ancestry sample n1605, the presence of any APOE-e4 alleles was associated with 1.77 95 CI 1.20, 2.61 times higher odds of dementia, while the AD polygenic score excluding the APOE genetic region was not significantly associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal cognition 1.06 95 CI 0.97, 1.30.DISCUSSION. Cumulative genetic risk for AD and APOE-e4 are both independent predictors of dementia. This study provides important insight into the polygenic nature of dementia and demonstrates the utility of polygenic scores in dementia research.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021667v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021667v2.full.pdf",20200211,"Epidemiology","Bakulski","/highwire/citation/72013/bibtext",35,"170220-35","17/02/2020",72013
"Isolevuglandins promote autoimmunity and hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus","Hypertension, vascular inflammation and renal inflammation are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus SLE, a multisystem autoimmune disease that is complex and poorly understood. Oxidation products of arachidonic and other fatty acids, termed isolevuglandins isoLG lead to formation of post-translational protein modifications that are immunogenic. We demonstrate isoLG enrichment in dendritic cells DCs, B cells, and plasma cells from juvenile female B6.SLE123 mice. In adult B6.SLE123 and NZBWF1 mice, isoLG adducts are enriched in plasma cells and splenic DCs compared to C57Bl/6 and NZW mice respectively. Treatment with the isoLG-scavenger 2-hydroxybenzylamine 2-HOBA reduced blood pressure, improved renal function, and attenuated renal injury. Moreover, 2-HOBA reduced bone marrow plasma cells, total IgG levels, and anti-dsDNA antibody titers. We also demonstrate that mice with SLE generate specific IgG antibodies against isoLG adducted protein, confirming the immunogenicity of isoLG adducts. Finall,y we found that isoLG adducted peptides are markedly enriched in monocytes from patients with SLE which was accompanied by an increase in superoxide production. These findings support a role of isoLG adducts in the genesis and maintenance of systemic autoimmunity and its associated hypertension in SLE. Scavenging of isoLGs promises to be a novel therapy for this disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021741v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021741v1.full.pdf",20200212,"Allergy and Immunology","Patrick","/highwire/citation/72029/bibtext",45,"170220-45","17/02/2020",72029
"Metabolomic changes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","Objective Widespread metabolic changes are seen in neurodegenerative disease and could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. They may also reveal disease mechanisms that could be a target for therapy. In this study we looked for blood-based biomarkers in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Methods Plasma metabolomic profiles were measured from 134 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia n30, non fluent variant primary progressive aphasia n26, progressive supranuclear palsy n45, corticobasal syndrome n33 and 32 healthy controls.Results Forty-nine of 842 metabolites were significantly altered in frontotemporal lobar degeneration after false-discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. These were distributed across a wide range of metabolic pathways including amino acids, energy and carbohydrate, cofactor and vitamin, lipid and nucleotide pathways. The metabolomic profile supported classification between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and controls with high accuracy 88.1-96.6 while classification accuracy was lower between the frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes 72.1-83.3. One metabolic profile, comprising a range of different pathways, was consistently identified as a feature of each disease versus controls the degree to which a patient expressed this metabolomic profile was associated with their subsequent survival hazard ratio 0.74 0.59-0.93, p0.0018. Conclusions The metabolic changes in FTLD are promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Further work is required to replicate these findings, examine longitudinal change, and test their utility in differentiating between FTLD syndromes that are pathologically distinct but phenotypically similar.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021758v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021758v1.full.pdf",20200212,"Neurology","Murley","/highwire/citation/72030/bibtext",46,"170220-46","17/02/2020",72030
"Predicting loss of independence and mortality in frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, behavioural impairment predicts loss of functional independence and motor clinical features predict mortalit,y irrespective of syndrome subtype. MethodWe used a transdiagnostic approach to survival in an epidemiological cohort, testing the association between clinical features, independence and survival in patients with clinical diagnoses of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia n64, non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia n36, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia n25, progressive supranuclear palsy n101 and corticobasal syndrome n68. A principal components analysis identified six dimensions of clinical features. Using Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression we identified the association between each of these dimensions and functionally independent survival time from clinical assessment to care home admission, and absolute survival time to death. Analyses adjusted for the covariates of age, gender and diagnostic group. Secondary analysis excluded specific diagnostic groups.ResultsBehavioural disturbance, including impulsivity and apath,y was associated with reduced functionally independent survival OR 2.46, p0.001, even if patients with bvFTD were removed from the analysis. Motor impairments were associated with reduced absolute survival, even if patients with PSP and CBS were removed from the analysis.ConclusionOur results may help individualised prognostication and planning of disease-modifying trials and support a transdiagnostic approach to symptomatic treatment trials in patients with clinical syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022061v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022061v1.full.pdf",20200212,"Neurology","Murley","/highwire/citation/72045/bibtext",56,"170220-56","17/02/2020",72045
"Alzheimers disease susceptibility gene apolipoprotein e APOE and blood biomarkers in UK Biobank N395,769.","Background and objective Alzheimers disease AD is a neurodegenerative condition where the underlying aetiology is still unclear. Investigating the potential influence of apolipoprotein APOE, a major genetic risk factor, on common blood biomarkers could provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms of AD and dementia risk. Our objective was to conduct the largest to date single-protocol investigation of blood biomarkers in the context of APOE genotype, in UK Biobank.Methods After quality control and exclusions, data on 395,769 participants of White European ancestry were available for analysis. Linear regressions were used to test potential associations between APOE genotypes and biomarkers.Results Several biomarkers significantly associated with APOE e4 risk and e2 protective genotypes vs. neutral e3/e3. Most associations supported previous data for example, e4 genotype was associated with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL standardized beta b  0.150 standard deviations SDs per allele, p0.001 and e2 with lower LDL b  -0.456 SDs, p0.001. There were however instances of associations found in unexpected directions e.g. e4 and increased insulin-like growth factor IGF-1 standardized beta  0.017, p0.001 where lower levels have been previously suggested as an AD risk factor. Conclusions These findings highlight biomarker differences in non-demented people at genetic risk for dementia. The evidence here in supports previous hypotheses of involvement from cardiometabolic and neuroinflammatory pathways.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021998v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021998v1.full.pdf",20200213,"Genetic and Genomic Medicine","Ferguson","/highwire/citation/72080/bibtext",74,"170220-74","17/02/2020",72080
"SMPD1 variants do not have a major role in REM sleep behavior disorder","Mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 SMPD1 gene were reported to be associated with Parkinson disease PD and dementia with Lewy bodies DLB. The majority of patients with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder iRBD develop PD or DLB later in life, suggesting that iRBD is a prodromal phase of these two conditions. In the current study we aimed to evaluate the role of SMPD1 variants in iRBD. SMPD1 and its untranslated regions were sequenced using targeted next-generation sequencing in 959 iRBD patients and 1,287 controls from European descent. Logistic regression adjusted for sex and age showed no significant associations with two common variants and iRBD rs1050239 and rs8164. The frequency of all rare nonsynonymous SMPD1 variants minor allele frequency 1 was found to be twice as high in cases than in controls 1.46 vs. 0.70, Fishers exact test p0.09 but there was no statistically significant burden p0.64.

"Expression profiles of circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs in extreme phenotypes of diabetic retinopathy","Recent evidences highlighted regulatory role of circular RNAs circRNAs and long non-coding RNAs lncRNAs in the development of diabetic retinopathy DR. However, the literatures and number of the RNAs identified were limited. Here, we compared the expression profiles of circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs in the blood of the susceptible individuals who developed severe DR within 5 years after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetic mellitus T2DM, and the inherently resistant individuals who are spared from DR despite over 20-year history of T2DM. Using RNA microarra,y hundreds of significantly differently expressed circRNAs, lncRNAs, and dozens of mRNAs were identified. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction verified the above findings. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the differentially expressed circRNAs were involved in platelet-derived growth factor binding, and mRNA and the cis-target genes of lncRNA participate in negative regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis suggested that the differentially expressed circRNAs were related to vitamin B6 metabolism and type 2 diabetes. The cis-target genes of lncRNAs are enriched in valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis and in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling pathway. The trans-target genes of lncRNAs are enriched in pathways such as vitamin B6 metabolism. Differentially expressed mRNAs are associated with type 2 diabetes and the vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that circRNAs and lncRNAs may be involved in the regulation of DR and lay a foundation for further researches into the underlying mechanisms.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023481v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023481v1.full.pdf",20200220,"Ophthalmology","Zhou","/highwire/citation/72262/bibtext",11,"210220-11","21/02/2020",72262

This population-based cohort includes a total of 502,602 individuals aged between 40 and 96 years old at baseline who were recruited between 2006 to 2010.Exposures Genetic variants robustly associated with the expression of target genes in whole blood based on P5x10-08 were used to construct gene scores using findings from the eQTLGen consortium n31,684.Main Outcomes and Measures Genetically predicted effects for each of the 8,851 genes were firstly evaluated with 5 measured outcomes from the UK Biobank in turn body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides. Effects surviving multiple comparisons from this initial analysis were subsequently analyzed using factorial Mendelian randomization to evaluate evidence of an additive beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease risk compared to a HMGCR genetic score acting as a proxy for statin inhibition. Finall,y a phenome-wide analysis was undertaken to evaluate predicted effects between prioritized targets and 570 outcomes in the UK Biobank to highlight potential adverse side-effects.Results 377 genetically predicted effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors were identified by Mendelian randomization based on P1.13x10-6. Of the 68 druggable genes, 20 candidate genes were predicted to lower cardiovascular disease risk in combination with statin treatment P7.35x10-4. Genes such as FDFT1 were predicted to have added benefit with statin therapy OR0.93 95 CI, 0.91-0.95 P2.21x10-10 but are unlikely to make safe targets due to their predicted effects on adverse side effects.

"Clinical features and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome in coronavirus disease 2019","Background The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 results in a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19. We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19.Methods This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined.Findings Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days range, 4 to 30 days follow-up period, 31 patients 28.4 died, while 78 71.6 survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 48.6 developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years, and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes 20.8 vs. 1.8, cerebrovascular disease 11.3 vs. 0, and chronic kidney disease 15.1 vs. 3.6. Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS.Interpretation The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactor,y which needs more attention from clinicians.

"Leading causes of mortality and prescription drug coverage in Canada and New Zealand","Background Canada may soon see the introduction of a national pharmaceutical insurance system. New Zealand has a government-funded healthcare system used by all residents that operates within a tight cost-containment budget. Objective To compare the main mortality causes in Canada and New Zealand and examine listings in current Canadian provincial public drug plans and the New Zealand national drug formulary. Methods Age-standardized mortality rates from 1985 to 2014 and data on hospital discharges and average length of stay in hospital for Canada and New Zealand were obtained from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developments website. Information on insured medications was obtained from Canadian provincial drug plan lists and the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Schedule current in mid-2019. Results Mortality rates for acute myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were higher, on average over the 30-year observation period, in New Zealand, but rates for malignancies and respiratory disorders were similar in the two countries. Reimbursement listing rates for drugs for cancer and some cardiovascular indications were lower in New Zealand than in Canada. Conclusions New Zealands drug coverage system has contained costs, but it restricts or denies access to new innovative medicines with the potential to improve patients lives. Although a New Zealand-style national pharmacare scheme in Canada would offer the opportunity to restrain drug expenditure, it would likely fail to satisfy patients and healthcare providers and diminish health outcomes, resulting in higher costs in other healthcare sectors.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024232v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024232v2.full.pdf",20200220,"Health Policy","Rawson","/highwire/citation/72340/bibtext",41,"210220-41","21/02/2020",72340
"Is glycaemia associated with poorer brain health and risk of dementia? Cross sectional and follow-up analysis of the UK Biobank","Objective To understand the relationship across the glycaemic spectrum with incident dementia, brain structure, and cognitive decline.Research Design and Methods UK Biobank participants, aged 40-69 at recruitment. HbA1c and diabetes diagnosis define baseline glycaemic categories. Outcomes included incident vascular dementia VD, Alzheimers dementia AD, hippocampal volume HV, white matter hyperintensity WMH volume, cognitive function and decline. All results are in reference to normoglycaemic individuals HbA1c 35-42 mmol/mol. Results 210433 47, 15246 3, 3280 0.7, 20793 5 individuals had low HbA1c, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes, respectively.  Pre- and known diabetes markedly increased incident VD, hazard ratios HR 1.51, 95CI1.012.25 and 1.96, 95CI1.492.58, respectivel,y less so AD 1.18, 0.921.52 and 1.13 0.95,1.33, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic variables. For VD, multivariate adjustment, driven by antihypertensives, attenuated associations, HR 1.27, 0.841.91 and 1.45,1.071.97. Pre- and known diabetes conferred elevated risks of cognitive decline odds ratio OR 1.53, 1.022.29 and 1.49, 1.022.18, respectively. People with pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and known diabetes had higher WMH volumes 4, 30, 3, respectivel,y and lower HV 34.51 mm3, 11.73 mm3 and 61.13 mm3 respectively. People with low-normal HbA1c 35 mmol/mol had 5 lower WMH volume and 13.6 mm3 greater HV than normoglycaemic individuals.  Conclusions Pre and known diabetes increase VD risks, less so AD.

"Polygenic modulation of lipoproteina-associated cardiovascular risk","Aims Elevated levels of lipoproteina are one of the strongest inherited risk factors for coronary artery disease CAD. However, there is variability in cardiovascular risk among individuals with elevated lipoproteina. The sources of this variability are incompletely understood. We assessed the effects of a genomic risk score GRS for CAD on risk of myocardial infarction among individuals with elevated lipoproteina.Methods We calculated CAD GRSs for 408,896 individuals of British white ancestry from the UK Biobank using 6.27 million common genetic variants. Lipoproteina levels were measured in 310,020 individuals. The prevalence and risk of myocardial infarction versus CAD GRS percentiles were compared for individuals with and without elevated lipoproteina defined as 120 or 168 nmol/L 50 or 70 mg/dL, respectively. Results Individuals with elevated lipoproteina displayed significantly greater CAD GRSs than individuals without elevated lipoproteina, which was largely dependent on the influence of genetic variants within or near the LPA gene. Continuous levels of CAD GRS percentile were significantly associated with risk of myocardial infarction for individuals with elevated lipoproteina. Notabl,y the risk of myocardial infarction for males with elevated lipoproteina levels, but a CAD GRS percentile in the lower quintile 20th percentile, was less than the overall risk of myocardial infarction for males with non-elevated lipoproteina levels hazard ratio 95 CI 0.79 0.64-0.97, p0.02. Similar results were observed for females.Conclusion These data suggest that CAD genomic scores influence cardiovascular risk among individuals with elevated lipoproteina and may aid in identifying candidates for preventive therapies.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026757v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026757v1.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Trinder","/highwire/citation/72614/bibtext",42,"270220-42","27/02/2020",72614
"Evidence of accelerated epigenetic aging in patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease Results of the LipidCardio study","DNA methylation DNAm age acceleration, defined as the deviation of chronological and epigenetic age determined by an epigenetic clock, has been proposed as a biomarker of biological aging. To address the above hypothesis in the context of cardiovascular disease, we evaluated whether patients N827, mean chronological age 69.82/-11.01 years, DNAm age 71.91/-16.11, residual DNAm age acceleration 0.00/-9.65 years, who were diagnosed with obstructive coronary artery disease CAD by coronary angiography were aged prematurel,y i.e. had an increase in the DNAm age acceleration, in comparison with patients for whom obstructive CAD was ruled out controls.Stratified analysis yielded a significant acceleration in DNAm age determined by a seven cytosine-phosphate-guanine epigenetic clock in patients diagnosed with obstructive CAD, defined by at least one 50 coronary stenosis N588, rDNA age acceleration0.58/-9.47, corrected p 2.05x10-3 compared to control subjects N145, residual rDNAm age acceleration -3.11/-10.51 years. Moreover, rDNAm age acceleration was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure beta0.069, 95 CI 0.027 - 0.112, p 1.44x10-3, sex beta-2.438, 95 CI -4.591 - -0.285, p 2.65x10-2, estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR, beta0.040, 95 CI 0.011 - 0.069, p 6.87x10-9 and smoking status beta-8.538, 95 CI -10.772 - -6.303, p 2,45x10-13.  Across studies, assessing CAD and its risk factors in the context of epigenetic age acceleration findings are remarkably inconclusive. While the here employed seven-cytosine-phosphate-guanine epigenetic clock suggests premature biological aging in CAD patients, compared to controls without coronary stenosis, its association with cardiovascular risk factors was limited.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026906v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026906v1.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Banszerus","/highwire/citation/72565/bibtext",16,"270220-16","27/02/2020",72565
"Fasting alters the gut microbiome with sustained blood pressure and body weight reduction in metabolic syndrome patients","Periods of fasting and refeeding may reduce cardiometabolic risk elevated by Western diet. We show that in hypertensive metabolic syndrome MetS patients n35, a 5-day fast followed by a modified DASH diet Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension reduced systolic blood pressure SBP, antihypertensive medication need, and body-mass index BMI at three months post intervention compared to a modified DASH diet alone n36. Fasting altered the gut microbiome, impacting bacterial taxa and gene modules associated with short-chain fatty acid production. Cross-system analyses revealed a positive correlation of circulating mucosa-associated invariant T MAIT cells, non-classical monocytes and CD4 effector T cells with SBP. Furthermore, regulatory T cells Tregs positively correlated with BMI and weight. Machine learning could predict sustained SBP-responsiveness within the fasting group from baseline immunome data, identifying CD8 effector T cells, Th17 cells and Tregs as important contributors to the model. The high-resolution multi-omics data highlights fasting as a promising non-pharmacological intervention in MetS.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20027029v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20027029v1.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Balogh","/highwire/citation/72574/bibtext",21,"270220-21","27/02/2020",72574
"Dermal trypanosomes in suspected and confirmed cases of gambiense Human African Trypanosomiasis.","BackgroundThe diagnosis of Human African Trypanosomiasis HAT typically involves two steps a serological screen, followed by the detection of living trypanosome parasites in the blood or lymph node aspirate. Live parasites can, however, remain undetected in some seropositive individuals, who we hypothesize are infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense parasites in their extravascular dermis.Methods and findingsTo test this hypothesis, we conducted a prospective observational cohort study in the gambiense HAT gHAT focus of Forecariah, in the Republic of Guinea. 5,417 subjects in this disease foci underwent serological screening for gHAT. Of these individuals, 66 were enrolled into our stud,y of whom 40 were seronegative, 8 were seropositive but unconfirmed, and 18 confirmed gHAT cases. Enrolled individuals underwent a dermatological examination, and had blood samples and skin biopsies taken and examined for trypanosomes by molecular and immuno-histological methods. In confirmed cases, dermatological symptoms were significantly more frequent, relative to seronegative controls. T. b. gambiense parasites were present in the blood of all confirmed cases but not in unconfirmed seropositive individuals. However, trypanosomes were detected in the dermis of all unconfirmed seropositive individuals and confirmed cases. After 6 and 20 months of treatment, dermal trypanosome numbers in skin biopsies of confirmed cases progressively reduced. ConclusionsOur results thus highlight the skin as a potential reservoir for trypanosomes, with implications for our understanding of this diseases epidemiology in the context of its planned elimination and highlighting the skin as a novel target for gHAT diagnostics.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026211v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026211v1.full.pdf",20200225,"Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","Camara","/highwire/citation/72587/bibtext",26,"270220-26","27/02/2020",72587
"Clinical and radiographic features of cardiac injury in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia","Objective To investigate the correlation between clinical characteristics and cardiac injury of COVID-2019 pneumonia. Methods In this retrospective, single-center stud,y 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 COVID-2019 patients including 2 deaths of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue EAT has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019.ResultsOf the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 4.88, 32 78.05, 4 9.75 and 3 7.32 patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 24.4 patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. Conclusion Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the heart functions of COVID-2019 patients and applying potential interventions for those with abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics, is vital to prevent the fatality.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027052v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027052v1.full.pdf",20200227,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Hui","/highwire/citation/72736/bibtext",101,"270220-101","27/02/2020",72736
"2019 novel coronavirus disease in hemodialysis HD patients Report from one HD center in Wuhan, China","The outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan has become a global epidemic of contagious diseases, which poses a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with underlined diseases. However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiolog,y clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of  T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v2.full.pdf",20200227,"Nephrology","Ma","/highwire/citation/72768/bibtext",118,"270220-118","27/02/2020",72768
"Estimation of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality - preliminary results","Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender.  Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics.We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortalit,y where 60 or older patients have an OR  18.8161 CI957.1997 41.5517. Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest OR12.8328 CI9510.2736 15.8643, along with chronic respiratory disease OR7.7925 CI955.5446 10.4319. Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 OR1.8518 CI951.5996 2.1270. Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. A final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027268v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027268v1.full.pdf",20200225,"Epidemiology","Caramelo","/highwire/citation/72551/bibtext",9,"270220-9","27/02/2020",72551
"microRNA signatures of perioperative myocardial injury after elective non-cardiac surgery prospective observational cohort study","Background Elevated plasma/serum troponin, indicating perioperative myocardial injury PMI, is common after non-cardiac surgery. However, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Acute coronary syndrome ACS is associated with the early appearance of circulating microRNAs, which regulate post-translational gene expression.

"Clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19","Background A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospitals electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male 65.9. More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years 80.5 and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity 76.8, including hypertension 56.1, heart disease 20.7, diabetes 18.3, cerebrovascular disease 12.2, and cancer 7.3. Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death 69.5, following by sepsis syndrome/MOF 28.0, cardiac failure 14.6, hemorrhage 6.1, and renal failure 3.7. Furthermore, respirator,y cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100, 89, 80.5, 78.0, and 31.7 of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia 89.2, neutrophilia 74.3, and thrombocytopenia 24.3 were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of 5 94.5, high systemic immune-inflammation index of 500 89.2, increased C-reactive protein level 100, lactate dehydrogenase 93.2, and D-dimer 97.1. A high level of IL-6 10 pg/ml was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days IQR 11-20, and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase p0.002, alanine aminotransferase p0.037 and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191v1.full.pdf",20200227,"Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","Zhang","/highwire/citation/72713/bibtext",88,"270220-88","27/02/2020",72713
"Clinical characteristics of 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","BackgroundAlthough the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19.MethodsFor this retrospective, single-center stud,y we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laborator,y radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. ResultsWe included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years SD 9.64, range 50-90. 2569.44 patients were males, and 11 30.56 female. 26 72.22 patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever 34 94.44 patients, cough 28 77.78 patients, shortness of breath 21 58.33 patients, and fatigue 17 47.22 patient. Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 96.88 patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients 70.59, decreased albumin 30.18, SD, 4.76 in 25 patients 80.65, elevated D-dimer 8.64 IQR, 2.39-20 in 27 patients 100, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase 502.5 U/L IQR, 410-629 in 26 patients 100. Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP 106.3 mg/L IQR, 60.83-225.3, PCT 0.61 ng/ml IQR, 0.16-2.10 and IL-6 100.6 pg/ml IQR, 51.51-919.5. Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therap,y and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy 25 69.44. All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days.  One 2.78 patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days.InterpretationLots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days.

"Association of Cardiovascular Manifestations with In-hospital Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 A Hospital Staff Data","Background The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 remain a huge threat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19.Aims This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations CVMs with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laborator,y radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs.Results Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5, while 87.8 of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 - 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever 82.9, myalgia or fatigue 80.5 and cough 63.4. While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue 80.5, fever 73.2 and cough 41.5. There were 95.1 cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5 and 41.5, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count 0.99 - 0.43 and 1.55 - 0.61, P0.001, more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission 50.0 and 11.8, P0.011, and more received oxygen support 79.2 and 23.5, P0.001. The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group 75.0 and 23.5, P0.001. Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events.Conclusions Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348v5","/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348v5.full.pdf",20200312,"Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","Liu","/highwire/citation/73408/bibtext",4,"130320-4","13/03/2020",73408
"Polygenic Risk Score Modifies Risk of Coronary Artery Disease Conferred by Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol","An individuals lifetime risk of Coronary Artery Disease CAD is determined by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Whilst adherence to a healthy lifestyle can help individuals with high genetic risk reduce their lifetime risk of CAD, the extent to which blood lipid levels affect CAD risk in individuals with varying genetic risk remains unknown. To explore how genetics, blood lipids and CAD risk interact, we derived a novel genome-wide polygenic risk score PRS for CAD. We then applied the PRS to individuals from the UK Biobank and divided them into Low PRS bottom 10 percentiles of PRS distribution, Intermediate PRS PRS in the 10th-90th percentiles, and High PRS top 10 percentiles, and further stratified individuals by blood lipid levels.We found that the elevated CAD risk conferred by high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C was modified by the interaction with PRS P-value interaction 0.005. Individuals with High PRS and whose LDL-C was Borderline between 130 and 160 mg/dL had higher CAD relative risk HR 3.10 95 CI, 2.55-3.76 than those at Intermediate PRS whose LDL-C were Very High 190 mg/dL HR 2.77 95 CI, 2.33-3.28. Furthermore, individuals with High PRS but whose lipid levels were below the following thresholds did not have a significantly increased risk for incident CAD LDL-C 130 mg/dL, total Cholesterol TC 200 mg/dL, LDL-CHDL 2.0 and TCHDL 3.0. In addition, individuals with Low PRS and Very High LDL-C 190 mg/dl did not have increased CAD risk, which was comparable to individuals with Intermediate PRS and Optimal LDL-C 130 mg/dL.Our results have important implications for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease. Currentl,y healthy individuals with Borderline LDL-C 130-159 mg/dL are not considered to be at high risk of CAD. Here we demonstrate that the combination of Borderline LDL-C and High PRS results in CAD relative risk which is greater than individuals without high polygenic risk, but whose LDL-C levels are high enough for statins to be recommended 190 mg/dL. This analysis therefore demonstrates that PRS can identify a proportion of the population who are at high-risk of CAD but who are invisible to current approaches for assessing CAD risk. Moreover, of perhaps greater significance is the evidence that individuals who have a combination of High PRS and Optimal blood lipid levels do not have greater risk of CAD than individuals without high polygenic risk and the same Optimal blood lipid levels. Our results suggest that high polygenic risk for CAD could be overcome by controlling blood lipid levels. We propose that incorporating PRS into CAD risk assessment early in life could allow individuals at high polygenic risk to benefit from tailored blood lipid guidelines and avoid lifetime exposure to potentially damaging PRS-dependent LDL-C levels.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029454v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029454v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Bolli","/highwire/citation/73031/bibtext",41,"060320-41","06/03/2020",73031
"High Density Lipoprotein pathway as a therapeutic target for coronary heart disease individual participant meta-analysis in 28,597 individuals with 4197 coronary events","Importance Cholesterol content in high-density lipoprotein particles HDL-C is associated inversely with coronary heart disease CHD, but findings from Mendelian randomization studies and randomized trials of HDL-C raising drugs have questioned whether this link is causal.  However, these analyses do not exclude a causal role for specific HDL sub-fractions of different densit,y mobilit,y size and composition. Objective To determine whether sub-components of the HDL pathway exhibit differing relationships with CHD risk.Design In seven longitudinal studies, we used factor analysis to reduce 21 measures of HDL particle size and lipid content to a smaller number of factors representing different components of the HDL pathway. We constructed factor scores and modelled their associations on CHD risk in adjusted Cox regression analyses. We pooled results using random-effects meta-analysis.Setting Seven population-, individual-, occupational- or community-based longitudinal studies in the UK and Finland.Participants 28,597 participants 49 female, mean age 59.6 years contributed to the analysis.Exposures Sub-components of the HDL pathwa,y characterized by 21 measures of HDL size and lipid content based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Main Outcomes Incident fatal or non-fatal CHD.Results We identified 4 HDL components with highly replicable across studies 3 were indices of particle size/composition extra-large XL, large L and medium/small MS, and the other an index of triglycerides TG carried in HDL of all sizes. After up to 17 years of follow-up, 4179 incident CHD cases occurred. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicit,y smoking, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes and LDL-C, higher levels of the XL and MS factors were linked to a reduced risk of CHD hazard ratio per 1 standard deviation SD increase 0.88 95 CI 0.85, 0.92 and 0.91 0.87, 0.94. In contrast, a SD increase in the level of the TG factor was associated with increased risk of CHD 1.10 1.07, 1.14.Conclusions and Relevance We found qualitative differences between sub-components of the HDL pathway and the risk of developing CHD. Discovery of the biological determinants of these components, possibly through genetic analysis, will facilitate selection of drug targets and inform trial design.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.19010173v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.19010173v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Mulick","/highwire/citation/73174/bibtext",36,"070320-36","07/03/2020",73174
"Key Points of Clinical and CT Imaging Features of 2019 Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Imported Pneumonia Based On 21 Cases Analysis","Background and Objective WHO Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,and the outbreak is still on-going.Chest CT had been a key component of the diagnostic workup for patients with suspected infection. In this retrospective stud,y we attempt to summarize and analyze the chest CT features of 2019-nCov infections, and to identify the typical features to improved the diagnostic accuracy of new coronavirus pneumonia NCP. MethodsChest CT scans and Clinical data of 21 patients confirmed NCP in our hospital were enrolled.These patients were divided into mild and sever group according to clinical manifestations described by the 6th clinical practice guideline of NCP in China. Main clinical and chest CT features were analyzed and identify. Results Fever 85.7 and cough 80.9 were the two main symptoms of NCP patients.More significantly higher incidence 85.7 of shortness of breath in the severe cases. Multiple lesions in both lungs and with incidence of GGO100,vascular enlargement 76.5 and cobblestone/reticular pattern70.6 were the major feature.The incidence of consolidation, mixed pattern and vascular enlargement features were up to 100 in the severe group, significantly higher than that of patients in mild group. In addition, the incidence of air-bronchogram, dilated bronchi with thickened wall and fibrosis in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the mild group. Conclusions Fever and cough are the typical clinical features of NCP patients, and chest CT mainly manifested as multiple lesions in both lungs, often accompanied by GGO, vascular enlargement and cobblestone/reticular pattern.Changes in these main CT features can indicate development of the disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030775v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030775v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Radiology and Imaging","Wu","/highwire/citation/73091/bibtext",61,"060320-61","06/03/2020",73091
"How to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from heart failure with computed tomography at initial medical contact during epidemic period","OBJECTIVES To compare chest CT findings in heart failure with those of Corona Virus Disease 2019 COVID-19 pneumonia.BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography CT has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated.METHODS Patients with heart failure n12, COVID-19 pneumonia n12 and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity GGO, consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology 8.3 vs. 67, p0.003, more peribronchovascular thickening 75 vs. 33, p0.041 and fissural thickening 33 vs. 0, p0.028, less peripheral distribution 33 vs. 92, p0.003 were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group.

"Prediction of Venous Thromboembolism Based on Clinical and Genetic Factors","BACKGROUND Both clinical and genetic factors drive the risk of venous thromboembolism. However, whether clinically recorded risk factors and genetic variants can be combined into a clinically applicable predictive score remains unknown. METHODS Using Cox proportional-hazard models, we analyzed the association of risk factors with the likelihood of venous thromboembolism in U.K. Biobank, a large prospective cohort. We created a novel ten point clinical score using seven established clinical risk factors for venous thromboembolism. We also generated a polygenic risk score of 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms to quantify genetic risk. The genetic score was categorized into high risk top two deciles of scores, intermediate risk deciles three to eight, and low risk lowest two deciles. The discrete clinical score led to the following approximate decile categorizations high risk 5 to 10 points, intermediate risk 3 to 4 points, and low risk 0 to 2 points. RESULTS Amongst the 502,536 participants in the U.K. Biobank, there were 4,843 events of venous thromboembolism. Analyses of established clinical risk factors and the most commonly used medications revealed that participants were at decreased risk of venous thromboembolism if they had ever used oral contraceptive pills hazard ratio, 0.88 95 confidence interval CI, 0.79 to 0.99 or if they currently used bendroflumethiazide hazard ratio, 0.84 95 CI, 0.74 to 0.95, cod liver oil capsules hazard ratio, 0.87 95 CI, 0.77 to 0.99, or atenolol hazard ratio, 0.79 95 CI, 0.68 to 0.91. Participants were at significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism if they were at high clinical risk hazard ratio, 5.98 95 CI, 5.43 to 6.59 or high genetic risk hazard ratio, 2.28 95 CI, 2.07 to 2.51 relative to participants at low clinical or genetic risk, respectively. Combining clinical risk factors with genetic risk factors produced a model that better predicted risk of venous thromboembolism than either model alone P0.001.  Participants at high clinical and genetic risk in the combined score had over an eightfold increased risk of venous thromboembolism relative to participants at low risk hazard ratio, 8.27 95 CI 7.59 to 9.00.CONCLUSIONS  By assessing venous thromboembolic events in over 500,000 participants, we identified several known and novel associations between risk factors and venous thromboembolism. Participants in the high risk group of a combined score, consisting of clinical and genetic factors, were over eight times more likely to experience venous thromboembolism than participants in the low risk group.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031054v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031054v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Kolin","/highwire/citation/73082/bibtext",58,"060320-58","06/03/2020",73082
"Acute Myocardial Injury of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019","Background Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID-19 in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidit,y acute myocardial injury AMI in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them.Methods We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients 28 men, 25 women age, 19-81 years. We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests including cardiac injury biomarkers, echocardiograph,y electrocardiograph,y imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 79.25 patients tachycardia n15, electrocardiography abnormities n11, diastolic dysfunction n20, elevated myocardial enzymes n30, and AMI n6. All the six AMI patients were aged 60 years five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Novel coronavirus pneumonia NCP severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI p0.001. All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein CRP levels, NCP severit,y and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.Conclusions Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients.

"Exploration the Standard diagnosis and treatment in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in a tertiary first-class hospital in Fujian Province","Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and clinical practice of guideline for prevention and treatment of Type 2 diabetes in China among the physicians. We took a tertiary first-class hospital in Fujian Province as an example to identify the differences between clinical practice and guideline.Methods  We selected 3000 inpatients with type 2 diabetes who visited at the tertiary first-class hospital in Fujian Province between September 2017 to November 2017,then retrospectively analyzed their clinical data, including  age, gender, height, weight, body mess index, admission departments, combined diseases, complications, course of disease, diabetes diet education, monitoring of blood glucose and blood pressure, the selection of hypoglycemic therapy and other secondary prevention measures .The data we obtained was analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software.Results  A total of 3000 effective inpatient were enrolledincluding 1724 male and 1276 female, the mean age of  patients was 66 years old ,the mean hospitalization days was 12 days. In this stud,y we found that1.only 60.9 of the patients have monitored HbA1C in nearly 3 months in the last year, 96.3 of patients have monitored blood lipid98.1 of patients have monitored the serum creatinine only 9.5 of patients have received comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist.2.After admission,73.3 of patients have received the education about diabetes diet 86.8 of patients have accepted the peripheral blood glucose monitoring among 2084 diabetic patients combined with hypertension, only 1868 patients 89.6 have received blood pressure monitoring.3. Among 202 patients who are newly diagnosed diabetes, there were 45 cases meet HbA1C  9.0 or FPG  11.1 mmol/ L, only 25 people 55.56 have received an intensive insulin therapy.4.Among 474 patients who have undergone an large or medium-sized surgical treatment, about 182 62.1 patients have started a hypoglycemic therapy before the operation, and only 196 41.4 patients have changed into intensive insulin therapy before surgery. 5. About 714 of diabetic patients who combined with a clear history of cardiovascular, only 548 76.8 patients have received antiplatelet therapy and 566 people 79.3 have used statin to lower blood lipid .6.In total, only 1685.6 patients have received a relatively standard diagnosis and treatment in non-surgical department, and only 40.1 patients in surgical department.Conclusion  There are still many deficiencies in clinical practice of type 2 diabetes guideline, even in tertiary first-class hospital ,there are also many physicians, especially non-specialist doctors, were not familiar with the knowledge of guideline for management of Type 2 diabetes. The acute exacerbation of diabetes in the global can take serious complications and bring heavy economic burden, so it required us to pay attention to the prevention and early treatment of diabetes.

"The role of the metabolic profile in mediating the relationship between body mass index and left ventricular mass in adolescents analysis of a prospective cohort study","Background We aimed to quantify the role of the plasma metabolic profile in explaining the effect of adiposity on cardiac structure. Methods Body mass index BMI was measured at age 11 in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Left ventricular mass indexed to height2.7 LVMI, was assessed by echocardiography at age 17. The metabolic profile was quantified via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at age 15. Multivariable confounder maternal age, parit,y highest qualification, maternal smoking, pre-pregnancy BMI, pre-pregnancy height, household social class and adolescent birthweight, adolescent smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity -adjusted linear regression estimated the association of BMI with LVMI and mediation by metabolic traits. We considered 156 metabolomic traits individuall,y jointly as principal components PCs explaining 95 of the variance in the NMR platform, and assessed whether the PCs for the metabolic traits added to the proportion of the association explained by established cardiovascular risk factors systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein, and glucose.Results A 1kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a 0.70 g/m2.7 0.53, 0.88 and 0.66 g/m2.7 0.53, 0.79 higher LVMI in males N437 and females N536, respectively. Established risk factors explained 3 95 CI 2 to 5 of this association in males, increasing to 10 95 CI 8, 13 when including metabolic PCs. In females, the standard risk factors explained 3 95 CI 2, 5 of the association, and did not increase when including the metabolic PCs.Conclusion The addition of the NMR measured metabolic traits appear to mediate more of the effect of BMI on LVMI than the established risk factors alone in adolescent males, but not females.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033324v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033324v1.full.pdf",20200310,"Epidemiology","Carter","/highwire/citation/73320/bibtext",18,"110320-18","11/03/2020",73320

"Dose-dependent oral glucocorticoid cardiovascular risk in people with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases","BACKGROUNDEvidence for the association between glucocorticoid dose and cardiovascular risk is weak for moderate and low doses. To quantify glucocorticoid dose-dependent cardiovascular risk in people with six immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.METHODS AND FINDINGSPopulation-based cohort analysis of medical records from 389 primary care practices contributing data to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to hospital admissions and deaths in 1998-2017. There were 87,794 patients with giant cell arteritis and/or polymyalgia rheumatica n25,581, inflammatory bowel disease n27,739, rheumatoid arthritis n25,324, systemic lupus erythematosus n3951, and/or vasculitis n5199 and no prior cardiovascular disease CVD. Mean age was 56 years and 34.1 were men. Median follow-up time was 5.0 years. Time-variant daily and cumulative glucocorticoid prednisolone-equivalent dose-related risks and hazard ratios of first all-cause and type-specific CVD.We found 13,426 15.3 people with incident CVD, including 6,013 atrial fibrillation, 7,727 heart failure and 2,809 acute myocardial infarction events. At 1 and 5 years, the cumulative risks of all-cause CVD increased from 1.5 in periods of non-use to 9.1 for a daily prednisolone-equivalent dose of 25.0mg, and from 7.6 to 29.9, respectively. We found strong dose-dependent estimates for all immune-mediated diseases hazard ratio HR for 5.0mg daily dose vs. non-use1.74, 95CI 1.64-1.84 range 1.52 for polymyalgia rheumatica and/or giant cell arteritis to 2.82 for systemic lupus erythematosus, all cardiovascular outcomes, regardless of disease activity level. The highest estimates were for heart failure and acute myocardial infarction.CONCLUSIONSWe estimated glucocorticoid dose-dependent cardiovascular risk in six immune-mediated diseases. Results highlight the importance of prompt and regular monitoring of cardiovascular risk and use of primary prevention treatment at all glucocorticoid doses.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034157v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034157v1.full.pdf",20200313,"Pharmacology and Therapeutics","Pujades-Rodriguez","/highwire/citation/73466/bibtext",2,"130320-2","13/03/2020",73466
"Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection","Background/introductionCOVID19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID19 severity.MethodThis study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID19 infection or ICU admission.ResultsOf the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies including 1813 COVID19 patients were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older 62.4 years compared to the non-ICU group 46 years, with a significantly higher proportion of males 67.2 vs. 57.1, p0.04. Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease pOR 3.70, 95 CI 1.83  7.46 and ICU admission pOR 6.55, 95 CI 4.28  10.0. Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups 4.5 and 9.7, respectivel,y COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease pOR 6.42, 95 CI 2.44  16.9 and ICU admission pOR 17.8, 95 CI 6.56  48.2. Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 95 CI 2.64  7.47 and 3.7 95 CI 2.22  5.99 times more likely to have an ICU admission respectivel,y compared to patients without the comorbidity.ConclusionsDyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severit,y COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID19.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1.full.pdf",20200316,"Public and Global Health","Jain","/highwire/citation/73573/bibtext",8,"170320-8","17/03/2020",73573
"US Mortality Due To Congenital Heart Disease Across the Lifespan from 1999-2017 Exposes Persistent Racial/Ethnic Disparities","ABSTRACTBackgroundCongenital heart disease CHD accounts for approximately 40 percent of deaths in United States US children with birth defects. Previous US data from 1999-2006 demonstrated an overall decrease in CHD mortality. The objective of our study was to assess current trends in US mortality related to CHD from infancy to adulthood over the last 19 years and determine differences by sex and race/ethnicity.MethodsWe conducted an analysis of death certificates from 1999-2017 to calculate annual CHD mortality by age at death, race/ethnicit,y and se.x Population estimates used as denominators in mortality rate calculation for infants were based on National Center for Health Statistics live birth data. Mortality rates in individuals 1 year of age utilized US Census Bureau bridged-race estimates as denominators for population estimates. We characterized temporal trends in all-cause mortalit,y mortality resulting directly due to and related to CHD by age, race/ethnicit,y and sex using joinpoint regression.Results There were 47.7 million deaths with 1 in 814 deaths due to CHD n58,599. While all-cause mortality decreased 16.4 across all ages, mortality resulting from CHD declined 39.4 overall. The mean annual decrease in CHD mortality was 2.6, with the largest decrease for those age 65years. The age-adjusted mortality rate decreased from 1.37 to 0.83 per 100,000. Males had higher mortality due to CHD than females throughout the stud,y although both sexes declined at a similar rate 40 overall, with a 3-4 annual decrease between 1999 and 2009, followed by a slower annual decrease of 1.4 through 2017. Mortality resulting from CHD significantly declined among all race/ethnicities studied, although disparities in mortality persisted for non-Hispanic Blacks versus non-Hispanic Whites mean annual decrease 2.3 versus 2.6, respectively age-adjusted mortality rate 1.67 to 1.05 versus 1.35 to 0.80 per 100,000, respectively.Conclusions While overall US mortality due to CHD has decreased over the last 19 years, disparities in mortality persist for males compared to females and for non-Hispanic Blacks compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Determining factors that contribute to these disparities such as access to quality care, timely diagnosis, and maintenance of insurance will be important moving into the next decade.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036525v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036525v1.full.pdf",20200318,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Lopez","/highwire/citation/73769/bibtext",55,"180320-55","18-03-2020",73769
"Elucidating mechanisms of genetic cross-disease associations an integrative approach implicates protein C as a causal pathway in arterial and venous diseases","Genome-wide association studies have identified many individual genetic loci associated with multiple complex traits and common diseases. There are, however, few examples where the molecular basis of such pleiotropy has been elucidated. To address this challenge, we describe an integrative approach, focusing on the p.Ser219Gly rs867186 AG variant in the PROCR gene encoding the endothelial protein C receptor, EPCR, which has been associated with lower coronary artery disease CAD risk but higher venous thromboembolism VTE risk. In a phenome scan of 12 cardiometabolic diseases and 24 molecular factors, we found that PROCR-219Gly associated with higher plasma levels of zymogenic and activated protein C as well as coagulation factor VII. Using statistical colocalization and Mendelian randomization analyses, we uncovered shared genetic etiology across activated protein C, factor VII, CAD and VTE, identifying p.S219G as the likely causal variant at the locus. In a recall-by-genotype study of 52 healthy volunteers stratified by p.S219G, we detected 2.5-fold higher soluble EPCR levels and 1.2-fold higher protein C levels in plasma per effect allele, suggesting the allele induces EPCR shedding from the membrane of endothelial cells. Finall,y in cell adhesion assays, we found that increasing concentrations of activated protein C, but not soluble EPCR, reduced leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, a marker for vascular inflammation. These results support a role for protein C as a causal factor in arterial and venous diseases, suggesting that PROCR-219Gly protects against CAD through anti-inflammatory mechanisms while it promotes VTE risk through pro-thrombotic mechanisms. Overall, our study illustrates a multi-modal approach that can help reveal molecular underpinnings of cross-disease associations.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036822v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036822v1.full.pdf",20200320,"Genetic and Genomic Medicine","Stacey","/highwire/citation/73883/bibtext",38,"250320-38","25-03-2020",73883
"Development and Evaluation of an Android-based Platform for Early MCI Detection in an Elderly Population","Background Mild cognitive impairment MCI is an intermediate stage of cognitive decline fitting in-between normal cognition and dementia. With the growing aging population, this study aimed to develop and psychometrically validate an android-based application for early MCI detection in elderly subjects.Method This study was conducted in two phases, including 1- Initial design and prototyping of the application named M-Check, 2- psychometric evaluation. After the design and development of the M-Check app, it was evaluated by experts and elderly subjects. Face validity was determined by two checklists provided to the expert panel and the elderly subjects. Convergent validity of the M-Check app was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment MoCA battery through Pearson correlation. Test-retest and internal consistency and reliability were evaluated using Intra-Class Correlation ICC and Kuder-Richardson coefficients, respectively. In addition, the usability was assessed by a System Usability Scale SUS questionnaire. SPSS 16.0 was employed to analyze the data.Result The apps usability assessment by elderlies and experts scored 77.11 and 82.5, respectively. Also, the correlation showed that the M-Check app was negatively correlated with the MoCA test r  -0.71, p 0.005, and the ICC was more than 0.7. Moreover, the Richardsons Coder coefficient was 0.82, corresponding to an acceptable reliability. Conclusion In this stud,y we validated the M-Check app for the detection of MCI based on the growing need for cognitive assessment tools that can identify early decline. Such screeners are expected to take much shorter time than typical neuropsychological batteries do. Additional work are yet to be underway to ensure that M-Check is ready to launch and used without the presence of a trained person.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037028v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037028v1.full.pdf",20200320,"Health Informatics","Roozrokh Arshadi Montazer","/highwire/citation/73870/bibtext",31,"250320-31","25-03-2020",73870

"Differential transcript usage unravels transcriptional alterations in Alzheimers disease human brains","Alzheimers disease AD is the leading cause of dementia in aging individuals. However pathophysiological processes involved in the brain are still poorly understood. Among numerous strategies, a comprehensive overview of gene expression alterations in the diseased brain has been proposed to help for a better knowledge of the disease processes. In this work, we compared the differential expression of genes in different regions temporal and frontal lobes of the brain of healthy and AD adult subjects using data from three large studies MAYO Clinic Mount Sinai Brain Bank MSBB and ROSMAP. We show that gene expression is dramatically altered in the temporal lobe TL, but not in the frontal lobe FL, suggesting regional specificities in transcriptional alterations. Moreover, we show that a large set of genes undetected in the classical differential expression DEG analysis show alterations in the transcript usage ratio in AD, i.e. differential isoform fractions. Interestingl,y the number of genes with differential transcript usage gDTUs is highest at advanced Braak stages and correlates with altered expression of genes associated with the splicing machinery. Using single-cell RNA sequencing scRNAseq data, we further assigned DEGs and gDTUs to individual cell types of the adult brain and observed similar signatures per cell type as to other two scRNAseq studies in AD. Lastl,y we show that 52 out of 116 genes located in the loci associated with AD risk and expressed in the adult human brain present DEG and/or gDTUs in the TL, whereas only 13 are altered in the FL of AD patients. Among those altered genes, we detect an increased expression of APP isoforms containing the Kunitz protease inhibitor KPI domain, which is associated with plaque deposition. Altogether, our work proposes a novel integrative strategy to analyze transcriptional data in AD based on both gene/transcript expression and cell-type specificities.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038703v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038703v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Neurology","Coelho","/highwire/citation/74204/bibtext",199,"250320-199","25-03-2020",74204
"Myocardial injury is associated with in-hospital mortality of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in Wuhan, China A single center retrospective cohort study","Background Since December 2019, a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread rapidly from China to other countries. In-hospital mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients are scarce.Objectives To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.Methods Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th Februar,y 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.Results A total of 110 patients with confirmed n80 or suspected n30 COVID-19 were screened and 48 patients female 31.3, mean age 70.5813.38 year old among them with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I hs-cTnI test within 48 hours after admission were included, of whom 17 17/48, 35.4 died in hospital while 31 31/48, 64.6 were discharged or transferred to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was levated in 13 13/48, 27.1 patents. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation SpO2 on admission HR 0.704, 95 CI 0.546-0.909, per 1 decrease, p0.007, elevated hs-cTnI HR 10.902, 95 1.279-92.927, p0.029 and elevated d-dimer HR 1.103, 95CI 1.034-1.176, per 1mg/L increase, p0.003 on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.Conclusions Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040121v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040121v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Zhang","/highwire/citation/74208/bibtext",203,"250320-203","25-03-2020",74208
"Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults","RAPID COMMUNICATION 22 March 2020Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults  Background The medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom to date at least have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background pre-COVID-19 mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England HDR UK - CALIBER, we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines 16 March 2020 in 3,862,012 individuals aged 30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available https//caliberresearch.org/portal, for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk RR of the impact of the emergency compared to background mortality of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. Findings 20.0 of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which  13.7 were age70 years and 6.3 aged 70 years with 1 underlying condition cardiovascular disease 2.3, diabetes 2.2, steroid therapy 1.9, severe obesity 0.9, chronic kidney disease 0.6 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD 0.5. Multimorbidity co-occurrence of 2 conditions in an individual was common 10.1.  The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions 5.9 in age70 years, 8.6 for COPD and 13.1 in those with 3 or more conditions. In a suppression scenario at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001 of the UK population, there would be minimal excess deaths 3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. At SARS CoV2 rates of 10 of the UK population mitigation the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as 13791, 34479 and 68957 at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. At SARS CoV2 rates of  80 in the UK population do-nothing, the model estimates the number of excess deaths as  110332, 275,830 and 551,659 at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. Interpretation We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages.  If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20 similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess, then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 suppression, 13791 when 1 in 10 mitigation and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected do nothing scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040287v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040287v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Public and Global Health","Banerjee","/highwire/citation/74205/bibtext",200,"250320-200","25-03-2020",74205
"Hypertension and Diabetes Delay the Viral Clearance in COVID-19 Patients","Objectives Comorbidities have significant indications for the disease outcome of COVID-19, however which underlying diseases that contribute the most to aggravate the conditions of COVID-19 patients is still largely unknown. SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is a golden standard for defining the recovery of COVID-19 infections. To dissect the underlying diseases that could impact on viral clearance, we enrolled 106 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan Universit,y Wuhan, China between Jan 5 and Feb 25, 2020.Methodology We comprehensively analyzed demographic, clinical and laboratory data, as well as patient treatment records. Survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modelling were employed to identify factors influencing the viral clearance negatively. Results We found that increasing age, male gender, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ACE2 associated factors including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases adversely affected the viral clearance. Furthermore, analysis by a random forest survival model pointed out hypertension, cortisone treatment, gender, and age as the four most important variables.

"Prediction of coronary disease incidence in the general population by circulating RNYYRNAderived small RNA","During the development of atherosclerotic lesion, s-RNYs small RNAs of about 24/34 nucleotides are derived by the processing of long Ro-associated non-coding RNAs RNYs in macrophages. The levels of serum s-RNYs have been found significantly upregulated in patients with coronary heart disease CHD compared to age-matched healthy individuals. The present study aimed to examine the predictive value of serum s-RNYs for CHD events in the general population. Within the frame of nested-case-control stud,y the GENES stud,y we measured the absolute expression of a RNY-derived small RNA, the s-RNY1-5p, in the serum of healthy individuals who encountered a CHD event within 12 years of follow-up n  31 Cases and compared them to individuals who remained event-free Controls n  30. The expression of s-RNY1-5p in serum was significantly upregulated in Cases compared to Controls p  0.027. The proportion of CHD event-free was significantly higher among individuals with serum s-RNY15p below the median value 631 molecule / mL.

"Automated interpretation of the coronary angioscopy with deep convolutional neural networks","Background Coronary angioscopy CAS is a useful modality to assess atherosclerotic changes, but interpretation of the images requires expert knowledge. Deep convolutional neural networks DCNN can be used for diagnostic prediction and image synthesis.Methods 107 images from 47 patients, who underwent coronary angioscopy in our hospital between 2014 and 2017, and 864 images, selected from 142 MEDLINE-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2019, were analyzed. First, we developed a prediction model for the angioscopic findings. Next, we made a generative adversarial networks GAN model to simulate the CAS images. Finall,y we tried to control the output images according to the angioscopic findings with conditional GAN architecture.Results For both yellow color YC grade and neointimal coverage NC grade, we could observe strong correlations between the true grades and the predicted values YC grade, average r value  0.80  0.02, p-value 0.001 NC grade, average r value  0.73  0.02, p  0.001. The binary classification model for the red thrombus yielded 0.71  0.03 F1- score and the area under the ROC curve AUC was 0.91  0.02. The standard GAN model could generate realistic CAS images average Inception score  3.57  0.06. GAN-based data augmentation improved the performance of the prediction models. In the conditional GAN model, there were significant correlations between given values and experts diagnosis in YC grade but not in NC grade.Conclusion DCNN is useful in both predictive and generative modeling that can help develop the diagnostic support system for CAS.","/content/10.1101/19001693v3","/content/10.1101/19001693v3.full.pdf",20200108,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Miyoshi","/highwire/citation/71060/bibtext",2,"090120-2","09/01/2020",71060
"Effects of a Mediterranean Diet and physical activity on atherothrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals","Objective. Following a Mediterranean diet MedDiet and being physically active decrease cardiovascular risk. However, their individual and combined effects on atherothrombosis biomarkers are unexplored. Approach and Results. In 358 random volunteers from the PREDIMED trial Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea, we assessed the 1-year effects of an intervention with MedDiet, enriched with virgin olive oil MedDiet-VOO N120 or nuts MedDiet-Nuts N119 versus a low-fat control diet N119, on atherothrombosis markers. In a secondar,y observational approach, we studied the associations of 1-year changes in MedDiet adherence, physical activity PA levels, and their combination, with 1-year differences in atherothrombosis biomarkers. The MedDiet-VOO intervention increased HDL platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase activity by 8.2 95 CI 0.92 15.6 and decreased HDL-bound a1-antitrypsin levels by 5.8 95 CI -11.6 -0.046 versus control diet. The MedDiet-Nuts intervention reduced non-esterified fatty acid levels by 9.1 95 CI -18.0 -0.19 relative to control. Only the low-fat diet was associated with increases in platelet factor-4 and prothrombin factor 12 concentrations versus baseline P0.012 and P0.003, respectively. Increments in MedDiet adherence 1 point were associated with lower fibrinogen levels -1.8, 95 CI -3.38 -0.17. Increases in PA 100 METs.min/d were linked to lower prothrombin factor12 -5.2, 95 CI -10.4 -0.077 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 concentrations -3.0, 95 CI -5.93 -0.12. Finall,y 1-point increments in MedDiet adherence plus 100 METs.min/d of PA were related to lower D-dimer levels -1.52, 95 CI -3.10 0.026 P-interaction0.047.Conclusions. Following a MedDiet and increasing PA were associated with improvements in atherothrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals.","/content/10.1101/19001909v3","/content/10.1101/19001909v3.full.pdf",20200221,"Nutrition","Hernaez","/highwire/citation/72369/bibtext",10,"230220-10","23/02/2020",72369
"Mechanisms of Arrhythmogenicity in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Insight from Noninvasive Electrocardiographic Imaging","Background Mechanisms of arrhythmogenicity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy HCM are not well understood. We hypothesized that HCM is characterized by the specific electrophysiological substrate as compared to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy ICM, or healthy individuals.Methods We conducted a prospective case-control study. The study enrolled HCM patients at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmia VT n10 age 619 y left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF 609, and three comparison groups healthy individuals n10 age 286 y LVEF70, ICM patients with LV hypertrophy LVH and known VT n10 age 649 y LVEF 3115, and ICM patients with LVH and no known VT n10 age 70  7y LVEF 4616.

"High occurrence of transportation and logistics occupations among vascular dementia patients an observational study","BackgroundGrowing evidence suggests a role of occupation in the emergence and manifestation of dementia. Occupations are often defined by complexity level, although working environments and activities differ in several other important ways. We aimed to capture the multi-faceted nature of occupation through its measurement as a qualitative instead of a quantitative variable and explored its relationship with different types of dementia.MethodsWe collected occupational information of 2121 dementia patients with various suspected etiologies from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort age M67, SD8 57 male MMSE M21, SD5. Our final sample included individuals with Alzheimers disease AD dementia n1467, frontotemporal dementia n281, vascular dementia n98, Lewy body disease n174, and progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration n101. Within the AD group, we used neuropsychological data to further characterize patients by clinical phenotypes. All participants were categorized into 1 of 11 occupational classes, across which we evaluated the distribution of dementia subtypes with Chi2 analyses. We gained further insight into occupation-dementia relationships through post hoc logistic regressions that included various demographic and health characteristics as explanatory variables.ResultsThere were significant differences in the distribution of dementia types across occupation groups Chi285.87, p.001. Vascular dementia was relatively common in the Transportation/Logistics sector, and higher vascular risk factors partly explained this relationship. AD occurred less in Transportation/Logistics and more in Health Care/Welfare occupations, which related to a higher/lower percentage of males. We found no relationships between occupational classes and clinical phenotypes of AD Chi253.65, n.s..ConclusionsRelationships between occupation and dementia seem to exist beyond the complexity level, which offers new opportunities for disease prevention and improvement of occupational health policy.","/content/10.1101/19005512v2","/content/10.1101/19005512v2.full.pdf",20200108,"Occupational and Environmental Health","van Loenhoud","/highwire/citation/71061/bibtext",1,"090120-1","09/01/2020",71061

"Psychiatric comorbid disorders of cognition A machine learning approach using 1,159 UK Biobank participants","BackgroundConceptualising comorbidity is complex and the term is used variously. Here, it is the coexistence of two or more diagnoses which might be defined as chronic and, although they may be pathologically related, they may also act independently 1. Of interest here is the comorbidity of common psychiatric disorders and impaired cognition. ObjectivesTo examine whether anxiety and/or depression are important longitudinal predictors of impaired cognition.MethodsUK Biobank participants used at three timepoints n 502,664 baseline, 1st follow-up n 20,257 and 1st imaging study n40,199. Participants with no missing data were 1,159 participants aged 40 to 70 years, 41 female. Machine learning ML was applied and the main outcome measure of reaction time intraindividual variability cognition was used.FindingsUsing the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC curve, the anxiety model achieves the best performance with an Area Under the Curve AUC of 0.68, followed by the depression model with an AUC of 0.64. The cardiovascular and diabetes model, and the demographics model have weaker performance in predicting cognition, with an AUC of 0.60 and 0.57, respectively.ConclusionsOutcomes suggest psychiatric disorders are more important comorbidities of long-term cognitive change than diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and demographic factors. Findings suggest that mental health disorders anxiety and depression may have a deleterious effect on long-term cognition and should be considered as an important comorbid disorder of cognitive decline. Clinical implicationsImportant predictive effects of poor mental health on longitudinal cognitive decline should be considered in primary care.","/content/10.1101/19006189v2","/content/10.1101/19006189v2.full.pdf",20200302,"Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology","Li","/highwire/citation/72885/bibtext",2,"030320-2","03/03/2020",72885
"Violin plot data A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity classified using laboratory measured valve motion","ObjectivesWe hypothesize that prosthetic valve thrombogenic potential may be inferred by valve regional flow velocity. This metric was used to compare two clinical valves and two experimental prototypes. Methods Four our clinical and experimental prototype valve models were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. Regurgitant flow velocity was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate / projected dynamic valve area. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, thrombogenic potential for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as regurgitant flow velocities relative to the control mechanical valve regurgitant flow velocity of -126 m/s. Analysis of the flow velocity data made use of Vioplot R and VISIO software packages to provide split violin plots that represent probability of recurrence of data. Results Thrombogenic potential was made dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and 1.0. Negative thrombogenic potentials arise when transient rebound of valve occluder is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive thrombogenic potentials occur during decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest thrombogenic potential transient of 0.15. A mock-transcatheter aortic valve replacement incorporating by design a trivial paravalvular leak 1.35 ml/s demonstrated a high transient thrombogenic potential of 0.95. Conclusions Our data reveals distinct thrombogenic potential profile differences between valve models. If our study methods are verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to produce advanced devices with significantly reduced thrombogenic potential.","/content/10.1101/19009407v7","/content/10.1101/19009407v7.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","SCOTTEN","/highwire/citation/72630/bibtext",56,"270220-56","27/02/2020",72630
"Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation for refractory scar-related ventricular tachycardia","BackgroundStereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiotherapy that is performed in a single session and focuses high-dose ionizing radiation beams from a collimated radiation source to a small, localized area of the body. Recentl,y stereotactic radiosurgery has been applied to arrhythmias stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation - STAR, with promising results reported in patients with refractor,y scar-related ventricular tachycardia VT, a cohort with known high morbidity and mortality.ObjectiveHerein, we describe our experience with the use of CyberKnife, a frameless image-guided linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery system, in conjunction with CardioPlan, a cardiac specific radiotherapy planning software, to treat patients with scar-related VT, detailing its early and mid- to long-term results.MethodsThis is a pilot, prospective study of patients undergoing STAR for refractory VT. The anatomical target for radioablation was defined based on the clinical VT morpholog,y electroanatomical mapping, and study-specific pre-procedural imaging with cardiac computed tomography. The target volume delineated with the aid of CardioPlan was treated with a prescription radiation dose of 25 Gy delivered in a single fraction by CyberKnife in an outpatient setting. Ventricular arrhythmias and radiation-related adverse events were monitored at follow-up to determine STAR efficacy and safety.ResultFive patients 100  male, 63  12 years old, 80  ischemic cardiomyopath,y left ventricular ejection fraction 34  15  with refractory VT underwent STAR between January and June 2018. Radioablation was delivered in 82  11 minutes without acute complications. During a mean follow-up of 12  2 months, all patients experienced clinically significant mid- to late-term ventricular arrhythmia recurrence two patients died of complications associated with their advanced heart failure. There were no clinical or imaging evidence of radiation necrosis or other radiation-induced complications in the organs at risk surrounding the scar targeted by radioablation.ConclusionDespite good initial results, STAR did not result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in a selected, high-risk population of patients with scar-related VT. The safety profile was confirmed to be favorable, with no radiation-related complications observed during follow-up. Further studies are needed to explain these disappointing results.","/content/10.1101/19012880v2","/content/10.1101/19012880v2.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Gianni","/highwire/citation/72533/bibtext",4,"270220-4","27/02/2020",72533
"A novel art of continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurement","Wearable sensors to continuously measure blood pressure BP and derived cardiovascular variables have the potential to revolutionize patient monitoring. Current wearable methods analyzing time components e.g., pulse transit time still lack clinical accurac,y whereas existing technologies for direct BP measurement are too bulky. Here we present a new art of continuous non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring CNAP2GO. It directly measures BP by using a new volume control technique and could be used for small wearable sensors integrated in a finger ring. As a software prototype, CNAP2GO showed excellent BP measurement performance in comparison with invasive BP in 46 patients having surgery. The resulting pulsatile BP signal carries information to derive cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables. We show that CNAP2GO can be miniaturized for wearable approaches. CNAP2GO potentially constitutes the breakthrough for wearable sensors for blood pressure and flow monitoring in both ambulatory and in-hospital clinical settings.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938v2","/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938v2.full.pdf",20200107,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Fortin","/highwire/citation/71056/bibtext",1,"080120-1","08/01/2020",71056
"A Preoperative Estimate of Central Venous Pressure Is Associated with Early Fontan Failure","Objective Early Fontan Failure EFF is a serious complication following total cavopulmonary connection TCPC, characterised by high central venous pressure CVP, low cardiac output and resistance to medical therapy. This study aimed to estimate post-operative CVP in TCPC patients CVPTCPC using data routinely collected during pre-operative assessment. We sought to determine if this metric correlated with measured post-operative CVP and if it was associated with EFF.Methods In this retrospective stud,y CVPTCPC was estimated in 131 patients undergoing pre-TCPC assessment by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and CVP measurement under general anaesthesia. Post-operative CVP during the first 24hours in ICU was collected from electronic patient records in a subset of patients. EFF was defined as death, transplantation, TCPC takedown or emergency fenestration within the first 30days.ResultsEstimated CVPTCPC correlated significantly with CVPICU r0.26, p0.03, particularly in patients without a fenestration r0.45, p0.01. CVPTCPC was significantly associated with EFF Odds Ratio OR 1.12 1.02-1.24, p0.02. A threshold of CVPTCPC  33mmHg was found to have the highest specificity 90 and sensitivity 67 for identifying EFF area under receiver operating curve, AUC  0.79, OR 18.8 3.1-114, p0.001. This association was stronger in patients with single SVCs.ConclusionsEstimated CVPTCPC is an easily calculated metric combining pre-operative pressure and flow data. Higher CVPTCPC is associated with an increased risk of EFF and is correlated with directly measured post-TCPC pressure. Identification of patients at risk of EFF has the potential to guide risk mitigation strategies.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016048v1","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016048v1.full.pdf",20200102,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Quail","/highwire/citation/70954/bibtext",13,"030120-13","03/01/2020",70954
"The role of Body Mass Index in high and low velocity trauma causing knee injury associated to popliteal artery lesions.","Background Osteoarticular traumas are particularly dangerous among arterial traumas, those associated with the popliteal artery are associated with a high amputation rate. Despite representing a minority of arterial traumas, with an incidence that considerably varies by population and geographic location, traumatic lesions of the popliteal artery are a challenge. This study aimed to verify the impact of BMI on arterial trauma damage and outcome.Methods Data were retrospectively collected from the emergency and operating rooms electronic medical reports at  our Institution between 1 January 2005 and 1 May 2018 of all osteoarticular and vascular associated lesion. 41 pts presented with lower limb arterial trauma 43.2, and popliteal artery lesions occurred in 11 26.8. 11 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. In addition, the lesion mechanism was dislocation by high-velocity trauma in 9 cases and by low-velocity trauma in 3. All 7 males 63.6 were affected by high-velocity trauma, and 2 of the 3 females by low-velocity trauma. Only one patient had an isolated popliteal artery lesion associated with fractures in the leg or in contralateral limb. Patients with low-velocity traumas were older than 54 years while those with high-velocity were aged from 22 to 71 years.Results The lesion mechanism was dislocation due to high-velocity trauma in eight patients and due to low-velocity trauma in three. In 10/11 patients 90.9  revascularization was performed after osteoarticular stabilization. after reduction of the dislocation or fracture. Intraoperative angiography was selectively used. Two patients required above-knee amputation after the procedure one due to infection of the surgical access and the other due to severe soft tissue injury. One patient died during hospitalization due to trauma-related complications and comorbidities.Conclusions Revascularization success is not associated with high- or low-velocity traumas. Furthermore, unlike high-velocity traumas, low-velocity traumas are associated with a body mass index 35kg/m2.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19015966v1","/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.19015966v1.full.pdf",20200103,"Primary Care Research","Ascoli Marchetti","/highwire/citation/70996/bibtext",5,"040120-5","04/01/2020",70996
"Cardiac Microstructural Abnormalities Identify Women at Risk of Incident Heart Failure","Background Incidence of congestive heart failure is difficult to predict by standard methods. We have developed a method called the signal intensity coefficient that uses echocardiographic texture analysis to quantify microstructural changes which may occur in at-risk patients prior to development of a clinical heart failure syndrome.Methods Participants from the Framingham Offspring Cohort study who attended the 8th visit and received screening echocardiography were included. Participants were followed for a mean of 7.4 years for incident congestive heart failure. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the hazard ratio of signal intensity coefficient in the top quartile of values versus other quartiles in the total and sex-stratified population.Results 2511 participants with interpretable echocardiography and no history of congestive heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction were included in this study. The top quartile signal intensity coefficient had a hazard ratio of 1.83 p0.0048 for incident heart failure. When additional clinical risk factors were added to the model, this became non-significant. Within women, an elevated hazard ratio was significant in multiple models including age and hypertensive medication use. Models were not significant in men.Conclusions Elevated signal intensity coefficient is associated with an increased risk of incident congestive heart failure. This trend remains significant in women after inclusion of age and hypertensive medication use. The signal intensity coefficient may be able to identify patients at risk of developing congestive heart failure using echocardiographic texture analysis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016477v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016477v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Kwan","/highwire/citation/71080/bibtext",24,"110120-24","11/01/2020",71080
"A Computational Approach for Exploring Herbal Inhibitors of Acetylcholinesterase in Alzheimers Disease","Alzheimers disease AD is the most common type of age related dementia. Many hypotheses shed light on several reasons that lead to AD development. The cholinergic hypothesis describes that destruction of an essential neurotransmitter, acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase AChE enzyme, leads to the AD onset. The hydrolysis of acetylcholine by excess amount of AChE decreases the amount of acetylcholine in the brain, thus interfering with the normal brain functions. Many anti- AChE agents can be used to treat AD by targeting AChE. In our stud,y 14 anti- AChE agents from plants 1,8-cineol, berberine, carvacrol, cheilanthifoline, coptisine, estragole, harmaline, harmine, liriodenine, myrtenal, naringenin, protopine, scoulerine, stylopine were tested against AChE and compared with two controls donepezil and galantamine, using different techniques of molecular docking. Molecular docking study was conducted for all the 14 selected ligands against AChE to identify the best three ligands among them. To determine the safety and efficacy of the three best ligands, a set of tests the druglikeness property test, ADME/T test, PASS & P450 site of metabolism prediction, pharmacophore mapping and modelling and DFT calculations were performed. In our experiment, berberine, coptisine and naringenin were determined as the three ligands from the docking study. Further analysis of these 3 ligands showed coptisine as the most potent anti-AChE agent. The molecular dynamics simulation study showed quite results for the coptisine- AChE docked comple.x Administration of berberine, coptisine and naringenin could be potential treatments for AD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016535v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016535v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Pharmacology and Therapeutics","Sarkar","/highwire/citation/71085/bibtext",23,"110120-23","11/01/2020",71085

"A blood miRNA signature associates with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease diagnosis and rate of progression","Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease sCJD presents as a rapidly progressive dementia which is usually fatal within six months. No blood tests are currently available for diagnosis or disease monitoring. Here, we profile blood microRNA miRNA expression in sCJD. Small RNA-sequencing of 57 sCJD patients and 50 healthy controls reveals differential expression of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, hsa-miR-106b-3p and hsa-let-7d-3p. Downregulation of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p and hsa-miR-93-5p in sCJD replicates in an independent cohort using quantitative PCR, with concomitant upregulation of four of their mRNA targets. This miRNA signature discriminates patients with sCJD from Alzheimers disease patients. Finall,y longitudinal monitoring of 15 sCJD patients shows that the rate of decline in miRNA expression significantly correlates with rate of disease progression. These findings highlight novel molecular alterations in human prion disease outside the central nervous system which can provide information about diagnosis, disease progression, and improve mechanistic understanding of sCJD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.19015214v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.19015214v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Neurology","Norsworthy","/highwire/citation/71077/bibtext",28,"110120-28","11/01/2020",71077
"Prospective Single Center Cohort Study for Early Diagnosis of Cardiac Dysfunction in Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivors A Study Protocol","Introduction Cardiovascular disease is the leading nonmalignant cause of late deaths in childhood cancer survivors. Cardiovascular disease and cardiac dysfunction can remain asymptomatic for many years, but eventually lead to progressive disease with high morbidity and mortality. Early detection and intervention are therefore crucial to improve outcome. In our stud,y we aim to 1 assess the prevalence of early cardiac dysfunction in adult childhood cancer survivors using conventional and speckle tracking echocardiograph,y 2 determine the association between cardiac dysfunction and treatment-related risk factors anthracyclines, alkylating agents, steroids, cardiac radiation and modifiable cardiovascular risk factors abdominal obesit,y hypertension, 3 investigate the development of cardiac dysfunction longitudinally in a defined cohort, 4 study the association between cardiac dysfunction and other health outcomes like pulmonar,y endocrine, and renal diseases, quality of life, fatigue, strength and endurance, and physical activit,y and 5 gain experience conducting a clinical study of childhood cancer survivors that will be extended to a national, multicenter study of cardiac complications.Methods We will invite 5 year childhood cancer survivors who were treated at the University Childrens Hospital Bern, Switzerland with any chemotherapy and/or cardiac radiation since 1976 and who are 18 years of age at time of study for a cardiac assessment at the University Hospital Bern. This includes overall 544 childhood cancer survivors, of whom about half were treated with anthracyclines and/or cardiac radiation and half with any other chemotherapy. The standardized cardiac assessment includes a medical history focusing on signs of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, a physical examination, anthropometr,y vital parameters, the 1-minute sit-to-stand test, and an echocardiography including speckle tracking. Results We will invite 544 eligible childhood cancer survivors for a cardiac assessment with a median age at study of 32.5 years and a median times since diagnosis of 25.0 years. Three hundred survivors 55 are at high risk and 244 survivors 45 are at standard risk for cardiac dysfunction. Discussion The results of this study will show the prevalence of early cardiac dysfunction in Swiss childhood cancer survivors, inform whether speckle tracking echocardiography is more sensitive to cardiac dysfunction than conventional echocardiograph,y and give a detailed picture of risk factors for cardiac dysfunction. The results will help improve primary treatment and follow-up care of children suffering from cancer.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017152v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017152v1.full.pdf",20200116,"Oncology","Schindera","/highwire/citation/71204/bibtext",21,"170120-21","17/01/2020",71204
"Ideal Cardiovascular Health in Urban Jamaica Prevalence Estimates and Relationship to Community Property Value, Household Assets and Educational Attainment","BACKGROUND Ideal cardiovascular health ICH is associated with greater longevity and reduced morbidit,y but no research on ICH has been conducted in Jamaica. We estimated the prevalence of ICH in urban Jamaica and evaluated associations between ICH and communit,y household and individual socioeconomic status SES.  METHODS Cross-sectional study using data from 360 men and 665 women, age 20 years   in urban Jamaica. ICH was defined as having seven characteristics current non-smoking, healthy diet, moderate physical activit,y and normal body mass index, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol.  Logistic regression, weighted for survey design, quantified association between the outcome 5 ICH characteristics ICH-5, and exposure variables tertiles of community median land value MLV, tertiles of household assets and educational attainment. RESULTS  Prevalence of ICH 7 characteristics was 0.51, while prevalence of ICH-5 was 22.9 male 24.5, female 21.5, p0.447. In sex-specific multivariable models adjusted for age, education, and household assets, men in the lower tertiles of community MLV had lower odds of ICH-5 compared to men in the upper tertile lowest tertile OR 0.33, 95CI 0.12-0.91, p0.032 middle tertile  OR 0.46 0.20-1.04 p0.062. Women from communities in the lower and middle tertiles of MLV also had lower odds of ICH-5, but association was not statistically significant. Educational attainment was inversely associated with ICH-5 among men and positively associated among women. No significant association was seen for household assets.CONCLUSION Prevalence of ICH is low in urban Jamaica. Living in poorer communities was associated with lower odds of ICH-5 among men. Higher education was associated with higher odds of ICH-5 among women but lowers odds among men.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.12.20017277v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.12.20017277v1.full.pdf",20200116,"Epidemiology","McKenzie","/highwire/citation/71263/bibtext",3,"170120-3","17/01/2020",71263
"Prognostic Imaging Biomarkers for Diabetic Kidney Disease iBEAt Study protocol","Diabetic kidney disease DKD is traditionally classified based on albuminuria and reduced kidney function estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR, but these have limitations as prognostic biomarkers due to the heterogeneity of DKD. Novel prognostic markers are needed to improve stratification of patients based on risk of disease progression.

"Pleiotropic effects of statins on ischemic heart disease a Mendelian Randomization study in the UK Biobank","Objectives Statins appear to have pleiotropic effects. We examined whether specifically statins, of the major lipid modifiers, operate on ischemic heart disease IHD via testosterone. As a validation, we assessed whether a drug that unexpectedly likely increases IHD also operates via testosterone.Design A sex-specific univariate and multivariable Mendelian randomization studySetting A large, population-based cohort study recruited in the UK from 2006-10, the UK BiobankParticipants 179918 men with 25410 IHD cases and 212080 women with 12511 IHD casesMain Outcome measures Testosterone and IHDResults Of the three lipid modulations considered, statins, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe, only genetically predicted statin use in men affected testosterone -0.26 effect size testosterone per effect size of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 95 confidence interval CI -0.39 to -0.13. The genetically predicted effect of statin use on IHD in men was partially mediated by testosterone odds ratio OR 0.54 per effect size of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 95 confidence interval CI 0.38 to 0.79, compared to OR 0.67, 95 CI 0.38 to 1.02 after allowing for testosterone. The genetically predicted effect of anakinra use also affected testosterone 0.04 per effect size of IL-1Ra, 95 CI 0.02 to 0.06, and increased IHD in men.Conclusions Statins may partially operate via testosterone in men, which may contribute to pleiotropic effects.

"Association Between Reduced Handgrip Strength and Commonly Prescribed Medications","Decreased handgrip-strength has become an increasingly important measure of overall health status and fitness. This was a cross-sectional analysis among adult participants in the 2011-2012 NHANES survey. Handgrip-strength was assessed using a digital dynamometer and a standard protocol, and medication use was assessed by self-report and verification by the interviewer. Mean handgrip-strength among participants with no medication use was 87.2kg in males and 57.2kg in females. Handgrip strength decreased significantly in both men and women ptrend0.001 for both with increasing medication use after adjustment for age, sex, height, arm circumference, and BMI. Statins, ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and sulfonylureas showed a consistent and significant decrease in grip strength in linear regression models. In this nationally representative survey of adults in the US, we observed a negative relationship between handgrip strength and polypharmacy. Further, several specific medications, mostly cardiovascular drug classes, were associated with reduced handgrip-strength.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017087v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017087v1.full.pdf",20200116,"Pharmacology and Therapeutics","Love","/highwire/citation/71225/bibtext",18,"170120-18","17/01/2020",71225
"Cerebrospinal fluid p-tau217 performs better than p-tau181 as a biomarker of Alzheimerrs disease","Cerebrospinal fluid CSF p-tau181 tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 is an established biomarker of Alzheimerrs disease AD reflecting abnormal tau metabolism in the brain. Tau can be phosphorylated at multiple other sites including threonine 217, and here we investigated the performance of CSF p-tau217 as a biomarker of AD in comparison to p-tau181. In the Swedish BioFINDER cohort n194, p-tau217 had stronger correlations with the tau PET tracer 18Fflortaucipir, and more accurately identified individuals with abnormally increased 18Fflortaucipir retention. Furthermore, longitudinal increases in p-tau217 were higher compared to p-tau181 and better correlated with 18Fflortaucipir retention. P-tau217 correlated better than p-tau181 with PET measures of neocortical amyloid- burden and more accurately distinguished AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. Higher correlations between p-tau217 and 18Fflortaucipir were corroborated in an independent EXPEDITION3 trial cohort n32. These findings suggest that p-tau217 might be more useful than p-tau181 in the diagnostic work up of AD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017236v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017236v1.full.pdf",20200116,"Neurology","Janelidze","/highwire/citation/71240/bibtext",12,"170120-12","17/01/2020",71240
"E-Cigarette Use and Subclinical Cardiac Effects","BACKGROUND. Electronic e- cigarettes are marketed as a safer alternative to conventional tobacco cigarettes. Although e-cigarettes contain a lower level of nicotine, the delivery method involves delivering an aerosolized bolus of poorly-characterized ultrafine particles that have unknown cardiovascular effects. METHODS. We studied apparently adult volunteers, free of any chronic disease, including non-smoking controls, chronic e-cigarette users, and chronic tobacco cigarette smokers. After overnight abstinence, we used myocardial contrast echocardiography to measure acute increases in myocardial blood flow MBFinduced by ischemic rhythmic handgrip stress, which causes sympathetically-mediated increases in myocardial work and oxygen demand and, in turn, shear stress, nitric oxide production, and coronary endothelial-dependent vasodilation.RESULTS. In non-smoking controls, handgrip stress increased myocardial blood flow, reflecting normal endothelial function. Chronic tobacco cigarette smokers demonstrated stress-induced blunting in myocardial blood flow change, when compared to non-smoking controls. Chronic e-cigarette smokers demonstrated a decrease, rather than increase, in myocardial blood flow change.CONCLUSION. Chronic e-cigarette users demonstrated substantially impaired coronary microvascular endothelial function, even more pronounced than that seen in chronic tobacco cigarette users. These findings suggest that chronic e-cigarette use leads to measurable and persistent adverse vascular effects that are not directly related to nicotine.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017780v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.16.20017780v1.full.pdf",20200118,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Rader","/highwire/citation/71303/bibtext",4,"190120-4","19/01/2020",71303

"Classification and prediction of frontotemporal dementia based on plasma microRNAs","Frontotemporal dementia FTD is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atroph,y typically manifesting with behavioural or language impairment. Because of its heterogeneity and lack of available diagnostic laboratory tests there can be a substantial delay in diagnosis. Cell-free, circulating, microRNAs are increasingly investigated as biomarkers for neurodegeneration, but their value in FTD is not yet established.  In this stud,y we investigate microRNAs as biomarkers for FTD diagnosis. We performed next generation small RNA sequencing on cell-free plasma from 52 FTD cases and 21 controls.  The analysis revealed the diagnostic importance of 20 circulating endogenous miRNAs in distinguishing FTD cases from controls. The study was repeated in an independent second cohort of 117 FTD cases and 35 controls. The combinatorial microRNA signature from the first cohort, precisely diagnosed FTD samples in a second cohort. To further increase the generalizability of the prediction, we implemented machine learning techniques in a merged dataset of the two cohorts, which resulted in a comparable or improved classification precision with a smaller panel of miRNA classifiers. In addition, there are intriguing molecular commonalities with cell free miRNA signature in ALS, a motor neuron disease that resides on a pathological continuum with FTD. However, the signature that describes the ALS-FTD spectrum is not shared with blood miRNA profiles of patients with multiple sclerosis. Thus, microRNAs are promising FTD biomarkers that might enable earlier detection of FTD and improve accurate identification of patients for clinical trials","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v2","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v2.full.pdf",20200128,"Neurology","Magen","/highwire/citation/71563/bibtext",1,"290120-1","29/01/2020",71563

"Feasibility of estimation of aortic wave intensity using non-invasive pressure recordings in the absence of flow velocity in man.","Background Wave intensity analysis provides valuable information on ventriculo-arterial function, hemodynamics and energy transfer in the arterial circulation. Widespread use of wave intensity analysis is limited by the need for concurrent measurement of pressure and flow waveforms. We describe a method that can estimate wave intensity patterns using only non-invasive pressure waveforms, and its reproducibility.Methods Radial artery pressure and left ventricular outflow tract LVOT flow velocity waveforms were recorded in 12 participants in the Southall and Brent Revisited SABRE study. Pressure waveforms were analysed using custom-written software to derive the excess pressure Pxs which was compared with the LVOT flow velocity waveform, and used to calculate wave intensity. In a separate stud,y repeat measures of wave intensity and other wave and reservoir parameters were performed on 34 individuals who attended 2 clinic visits at an interval of approximately 1 month to assess reproducibility and reliability of the method.Results Pxs waveforms were similar in shape to aortic flow velocity waveforms and the time of peak Pxs and maximum aortic velocity agreed closely mean difference  0.00 limits of agreement -0.02, 0.02s. Wave intensity patterns when scaled to peak LVOT velocity gave credible estimates of wave intensity similar to values reported previously in the literature. The method showed fair to good reproducibility for most parameters.Conclusions The Pxs is a surrogate of LVOT flow velocity allowing estimation of aortic wave intensity with acceptable reproducibility. This enables widespread application of wave intensity analysis to large studies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018457v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018457v1.full.pdf",20200124,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Hughes","/highwire/citation/71376/bibtext",5,"250120-5","25/01/2020",71376

"A Pilot Study of an Esophageal Cooling Device During Radiofrequency Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation","Background Esophageal thermal injury is a risk of ablation of the posterior left atrium despite various devices utilized to date.  Objective Evaluate the potential of a commercially-available esophageal cooling device to provide esophageal protection during left atrial catheter ablation. Methods In this pilot stud,y we randomized 6 patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.  Three patients received standard of care for our site use of a single-sensor temperature probe, with adjunct iced-water instillation for any temperature increases 1C.  Three patients received standard ablation after placement of the esophageal cooling device using a circulating water temperature of 4C.  All patients underwent transesophageal echocardiogram TEE and esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD on the day prior to ablation followed by EGD on the day after. Results In the 3 control patients, one had no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, one had diffuse sloughing of the esophageal mucosa and multiple ulcerations, and one had a superficial ulcer with large clot.  Both patients with lesions were classified as Zargar 2a.  In the 3 patients treated with the cooling device, one had no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, one had esophageal erythema Zargar 1, and one had a solitary Zargar 2a lesion.

"Preservation of cognition in hypertension-treated South Indian rural population","Change in diet life style and increased life expectancy has led to the dramatic escalation in old age related complication like cognitive decline leading to dementia. Cardiovascular diseases CVD are huge risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer disease AD. Hypertension is very well known to cause cognitive impairment.  Control of CVD could provide protection against dementia. Earlier in the mouse model of AD, reserpine, an antihypertensive and antipsychotic drug could elicit improvement in the working memory in AD model mice and enhance the same in normal mice. Hence, Cognitive protection in the patients on chronic antihypertensive drug which contains reserpine was evaluated. Cognition in a cohort in the South Indian rural population of hypertensive patients majority age group 50 to 70 years who have been chronically treated with a combinatorial drugadelphane/adelphane esidrexsodl by Novaritis Switzerland consisting of reserpine and hydrazine for years was compared with controls without hypertension. The cohorts were age sex socio-economic education background matched. Cognition was scored using the Tamil version of Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination-III ACEIII Tamil and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tamil scales.  The composite ACEIII Tamil score of control and treated groups were 53.6 and   53.2 respectively. MoCAtamil scores Control 15.1 and Treated 14.7 did not show much alteration. Further the mean scores of the control and treated groups individual components of cognition in ACE, namely Attention Memory Fluency Language and visuospatial cognitive skills also did not reveal significant difference. Thus controlling blood pressure or hypertension with chronic antihypertensive medication like adelphane/adelphane esirdex reserpine containing drugs has retained normal cognition in both genders.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019125v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019125v1.full.pdf",20200129,"Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology","Subramaniam","/highwire/citation/71597/bibtext",7,"300120-7","30/01/2020",71597
"A Precision Medicine Framework for Personalized Simulation of Hemodynamics in Cerebrovascular Disease","IntroductionCerebrovascular disease is a major public health challenge. An important biomarker is cerebral hemodynamics. To measure cerebral hemodynamics, however, only invasive, potentially harmful or time-to-treatment prolonging methods are available. We present a simulation-based alternative which allows calculation of cerebral hemodynamics based on the individual vessel configuration of a patient derived from structural vessel imaging. MethodsWe implemented a framework allowing annotation of extracted brain vessels from structural imaging followed by 0-dimensional lumped modelling of cerebral hemodynamics. For annotation, a 3D-graphical user interface GUI was implemented. For 0D-simulation, we used a modified nodal analysis MNA, which was adapted for easy implementation by code. The code was written in-house in java. The simulation GUI allows inspection of simulation results, identification of vulnerable areas, simulation of changes due to different systemic blood pressures. Moreover, sensitivity analysis was implemented allowing the live simulation of changes of variables such as vessel lumen to simulate procedures and disease courses. In two exemplary patients, simulation results were compared to dynamic-susceptibility-weighted-contrast-enhanced magnetic-resonanceDSC-MR perfusion imaging.ResultsThe successful implementation of the framework allowing individualized annotation and simulation of patients is presented. In two exemplary patients, both the simulation as well as DSC-MRI showed the same results pertaining to the identification of areas vulnerable to ischemia. Sensitivity analysis allows the individualized simulation of changes in vessel lumen and the effect on hemodynamics.DiscussionWe present the first precision medicine pipeline for cerebrovascular disease which allows annotation of the arterial vasculature derived from structural vessel imaging followed by personalized simulation of brain hemodynamics. This paves the way for further development of precision medicine in stroke using novel biomarkers and might make the application of harmful and complex perfusion methods obsolete for certain use cases in the future.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019190v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019190v1.full.pdf",20200129,"Neurology","Frey","/highwire/citation/71606/bibtext",3,"300120-3","30/01/2020",71606
"Developing an Individualized Clinical Prediction Rules of Antihypertensive Drugs A Study Protocol Based on Real-world Practice","Background Hypertension is one of the most urgent public health challenges, and drug therapy is the primary method to control blood pressure for patients. However, blood pressure control rate is still poor with antihypertensive drugs use. Although Clinical Prediction Rules CPR is useful to help clinicians make more appropriate decisions at the point of medication, the evidence is still limited in china. The objective of this study is to develop an CPR of antihypertensive drugs in individualized application of patients based on real-world practice.Methods  A two-way cohort study has been conducted in one Chinas large tertiary hospital using clinical information on patient characteristics, drug use and clinical outcome. Data extraction is through ICD-10 disease codes of hypertension from Electronic Medical Record System. Eligible patients admitted from September 2016 to August 2018 who have received at least one antihypertensive drug therapy is included. Patients were grouped into several exposure groups according to medications. COX regression model and clinical specialty survey is applied to identify Influencing Factors IF in different study groups, and the discriminant model was used to construct a CPR according IF. The accuracy of the CPR is analyzed by sensitivit,y specificit,y Youdens index and Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC curve.Discussion Result is expected to provide valuable CPR for physicians and policymakers with respect to treating hypertension according characteristic of individual patients.

"A genetic model of ivabradine recapitulates results from randomized clinical trials","Background. Naturally occurring human genetic variants provide a valuable tool to identify drug targets and guide drug prioritization and clinical trial design. Ivabradine is a heart rate lowering drug with protective effects on heart failure despite increasing the risk of atrial fibrillation. In patients with coronary artery disease without heart failure, the drug does not protect against major cardiovascular adverse events prompting questions about the ability of genetics to have predicted those effects. This study evaluates the effect of a mutation in HCN4, ivabradines drug target, on safety and efficacy endpoints.Methods. We used genetic association testing and Mendelian randomization to predict the effect of ivabradine and heart rate lowering on cardiovascular outcomes.Results. Using data from the UK Biobank and large GWAS consortia, we evaluated the effect of a heart rate-reducing genetic variant at the HCN4 locus encoding ivabradines drug target. These genetic association analyses showed increases in risk for atrial fibrillation OR 1.09, 95 CI 1.06-1.13, P9.3  10-9 in the UK Biobank. In a cause-specific competing risk model to account for the increased risk of atrial fibrillation, the HCN4 variant reduced incident heart failure in participants that did not develop atrial fibrillation HR 0.90, 95 CI 0.83-0.98, P0.013. In contrast, the same heart rate reducing HCN4 variant did not prevent a composite endpoint of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death OR 0.99, 95 CI 0.93-1.04, P0.61.Conclusion. Genetic modelling of ivabradine recapitulates its benefits in heart failure, promotion of atrial fibrillation, and neutral effect on myocardial infarction.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019521v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019521v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Legault","/highwire/citation/71682/bibtext",27,"040220-27","04/02/2020",71682
"Amyloid-beta CSF/PET discordance vs tau load 5 years later It takes two to tangle","OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between discordant amyloid-A PET and CSF biomarkers at baseline and the emergence of tau pathology 5 years later. METHODS We included 730 ADNI participants without dementia 282 cognitively normal, 448 mild cognitive impairment with baseline 18FFlorbetapir PET and CSF A42 available. Amyloid- CSF/PET status was determined at baseline using established cut-offs. Longitudinal data was available for 18Fflorbetapir A PET baseline to 4.31.9 years, CSF ptau baseline to 2.00.1 years, cognition baseline to 4.32.0 years, and 18Fflortaucipir tau PET measured 5.21.2 years after baseline to 1.60.7 years later. We used linear mixed modelling to study the association between amyloid- CSF/PET status and tau pathology measured in CSF or using PET. Additionall,y we calculated the proportion of CSF/PET- participants who during follow-up i progressed to amyloid- CSF/PET, and/or ii became tau-positive based on 18Fflortaucipir PET. RESULTS Amyloid- CSF/PET N318 participants had elevated CSF ptau levels and worse cognitive performance at baseline, while CSF/PET- N80 participants were overall similar to the CSF-/PET- N306 group. Five years after baseline, 18Fflortaucipir PET uptake in the CSF/PET- group 1.200.13 did not differ from CSF-/PET- 1.180.08, p0.69, but was substantially lower than CSF/PET 1.480.44, p0.001. Of the CSF/PET- subjects, 21/64 33 progressed to amyloid- CSF/PET, whereas only one 3, difference p0.05 became tau-positive based on 18Fflortaucipir PET. CONCLUSIONS Sufficient amyloid- load detectable by both CSF and PET is required before substantial tau deposition emerges. Compared to participants with abnormal amyloid- levels on PET and CSF, the CSF/PET- group has a distinctly better prognosis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019539v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019539v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Neurology","Reimand","/highwire/citation/71681/bibtext",26,"040220-26","04/02/2020",71681
"Collapsing the list of myocardial infarction-related differential expressed genes into a diagnostic signature","Myocardial infarction MI is one of the most severe manifestations of coronary artery disease CAD and the leading cause of death from non-infectious diseases worldwide. It is known that the central component of CAD pathogenesis is a chronic vascular inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying the changes that occur in T, B and NK lymphocytes, monocytes and other immune cells during CAD and MI are still poorly understood. One of those pathogenic mechanisms might be the dysregulation of intracellular signaling pathways in the immune cells. In the present study we performed a transcriptome profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MI patients and controls. The machine learning algorithm was then used to search for MI-associated signatures, that could reflect the dysregulation of intracellular signaling pathways. The genes ADAP2, KLRC1, MIR21, PDGFD and CD14 were identified as the most important signatures for the classification model with L1-norm penalty function. The classifier output quality was equal to 0.911 by Receiver Operating Characteristic metric on test data. These results were validated on two independent open GEO datasets. Identified MI-associated signatures can be further assisted in MI diagnosis and/or prognosis. Thus, our study presents a pipeline for collapsing the list of differential expressed genes, identified by high-throughput techniques, in order to define disease-associated diagnostic signatures.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019554v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019554v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Genetic and Genomic Medicine","Osmak","/highwire/citation/71683/bibtext",25,"040220-25","04/02/2020",71683
"Apolipoprotein E genotype, lifestyle and coronary artery disease gene-environment interaction analyses in the UK Biobank population","Introduction Carriers of the APOE U03F54 genotype have an increased risk for developing coronary artery disease CAD, but there is preliminary evidence that lifestyle factors interact with APOE genotype on CAD risk. Here, we assessed the interactions of physical activit,y oily fish intake and polyunsaturated fatty acid PUFA intake with APOE genotype on risk of incident cardiovascular disease in a large population of middle-aged individuals. Methods The present study was embedded in the UK Biobank population and comprised 344,092 European participants mean age 56.5 years, 45.7 men without a history of CAD. Information regarding physical activit,y oily fish intake and PUFA intake was collected through questionnaires, and information on incident CAD through linkage with hospital admission records. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age and se.x Results A higher physical activity level and a higher intake of oily fish were associated with a lower incidence of CAD. These associations were similar across all APOE isoform groups p-values for interaction  0.05. A higher PUFA intake was only associated with a lower CAD risk in APOE e4 carriers hazard ratio 0.76, 95 confidence interval 0.62,0.90, however, no statistically significant interaction was observed p-valueinteraction  0.137. Conclusion While higher physical activit,y fish intake and PUFA intake all decreased the risk of CAD, no evidence for interaction of these lifestyle factors with APOE genotype was observed in UK Biobank participants. Interventions intended to reduce cardiovascular risk might therefore be similarly effective across the APOE isoform carriers.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019620v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019620v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Bos","/highwire/citation/71699/bibtext",18,"040220-18","04/02/2020",71699
"Deep Learning for pericardial fat extraction and evaluation on a population study","The pericardial fat represents a powerful promising index which has been seen to correlate with several cardiovascular events. We propose a novel approach to automatically measure it from CT scans and we seek to explore how it is distributed in a study population. We studied a population of 1528 patients where 47 3 showed a cardiac event. The fat segmentation model was based on a deep neural network to identify the heart and from it, the pericardial fat was extract by threshold. Statistical analysis was finally computed to stratify the population according the quantity of pericardial fat. The high segmentation quality was reported with a Dice index 92.5 and a Pearson coefficient 0.990, p0.001.

"Improving Esophageal Protection during AF ablation the IMPACT study.","Background Thermal injury to the esophagus is a known complication of ablation for atrial fibrillation AF and accounts for most procedure-related mortality. Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen by infusing cold liquid can reduce thermal injury to a limited extent. Objective To investigate the ability of a powerful temperature control device to protect the esophagus from ablation-related thermal injury.Methods A single-center, prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial was used to investigate the ability of the ensoETM device to protect the esophagus from thermal injury. This method was compared in a 11 randomization to a control group of standard practice utilizing a single-point temperature probe. In the study group, the device was used to keep the luminal temperature at 4 degrees during radiofrequency RF ablation for AF. Endoscopic examination was performed at 7 days post-ablation and esophageal injury was scored. The patient and the endoscopist were blinded to the randomization.Results We recruited 188 patients, of whom 120 underwent endoscopy. Thermal injury to the mucosa was significantly more common in the control group than in those receiving esophageal protection 12/60 versus 2/60 P0.008, with a trend toward reduction in gastroparesis 6/60 Vs 2/60, p0.27. There was no difference between groups in RF duration, force, power and combined ablation index P value range 0.2-0.9. Procedure duration and fluoroscopy duration were similar P0.97, P0.91 respectively. Conclusion Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen significantly reduces ablation-related thermal injury compared to standard care. This method of esophageal protection is safe and does not compromise the efficacy of the ablation procedure.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019158v2","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019158v2.full.pdf",20200204,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Leung","/highwire/citation/71777/bibtext",18,"060220-18","06/02/2020",71777
"Hemodynamic modeling of aspirin effects on BOLD responses at 7T","Aspirin is considered a potential confound for functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies. This is because aspirin affects the synthesis of prostaglandin, a vasoactive mediator centrally involved in neurovascular coupling, a process that underlies the blood oxygenated level dependent BOLD response. Aspirin-induced changes in BOLD signal are a potential confound for fMRI studies of patients e.g. with cardiovascular conditions or stroke who receive low-dose aspirin prophylactically and are compared to healthy controls that do not take aspirin. To examine the severity of this potential confound, we combined high field 7 Tesla MRI during a simple hand movement task with a biophysically informed hemodynamic model. Comparing elderly volunteers with vs. without aspirin medication, we tested for putative effects of low-dose chronic aspirin on the BOLD response. Specificall,y we fitted hemodynamic models to BOLD signal time courses from 14 regions of the human motor system and examined whether model parameter estimates were significantly altered by aspirin. While our analyses indicate that hemodynamics differed across regions, consistent with the known regional variability of the BOLD response, we neither found a significant main effect of aspirin i.e., an average effect across brain regions nor an expected drugregion interaction. While our sample size is not sufficiently large to rule out small-to-medium global effects of aspirin, we had adequate statistical power for detecting the expected interaction. Altogether, our analysis suggests that low-dose aspirin, as used for prophylactic purposes, does not strongly affect BOLD signals and may not represent a critical confound for fMRI studies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019729v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019729v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Radiology and Imaging","Do","/highwire/citation/71740/bibtext",8,"040220-8","04/02/2020",71740
"Initiation of smoking and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes a mendelian randomization study","Objectives To evaluate the association between smoking behavior and type 2 diabetes risk using genetic data. Research Design and Methods We obtained summary data from genome-wide association studies GWAS related to smoking behavior n1.2 million people and type 2 diabetes n898,130 in individuals of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using these summary-level statistics. Specificall,y we assessed if genetically determined smoking initiation, smoking cessation, and smoking heaviness number of cigarettes per day modulated susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Results We observed that for each 2-fold increased odds of initiating smoking behavior corresponded with a 21 increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes OR  1.21, 95 CI 1.18-1.24, P1x10-12. Our effect was consistent across instrumental variable methodological approaches, and we did not observe evidence of systematic biases to our effect estimate. When analyzed using an analogous approach, we found that the effect of smoking initiation increasing diabetes risk was equivalent to the effect of smoking behavior on increase coronary artery disease, an established causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Conclusions Genetic data supports the hypothesis that smoking initiation corresponds with increased risk for type 2 diabetes. These findings are consistent with previous clinical epidemiological association between smoking behavior and elevated type 2 diabetes risk. Individual-level MR studies are necessary to estimate mediators and confounders related to this association.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019737v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019737v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Genetic and Genomic Medicine","Thom","/highwire/citation/71716/bibtext",13,"040220-13","04/02/2020",71716
"Association of the use of hearing aids with the incidence and progression of dementia A longitudinal retrospective study","Background Hearing aid usage has been linked to improvements in cognition, communication, and socialization, but the extent to which it can affect the onset and progression of dementia is unknown. This study leveraged the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to longitudinally examine the association between the use of hearing aids and risk of progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment MCI to dementia as well as progression of dementia in hearing-impaired adults.MethodsThe sample included 977 participants aged 50 with MCI or all-cause dementia enrolled between 2005 and 2018. Participants were classified into four groups according to the definition of the duration of disease stage Group 1, 450 participants with MCI at baseline that developed dementia during follow up Group 2, 314 participants diagnosed with dementia at baseline and subsequently died during follow-up Group 3, 126 healthy participants who were later diagnosed with MCI and then dementia at follow-up Group 4, 87 participants with MCI at baseline who later converted to dementia and subsequently died during follow-up. Groups 3 and 4 were used to better capture the duration of MCI-to-dementia and dementia-to-death periods. Kaplan-Meier survival functions and survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to assess the effect of hearing aid use on risk of MCI-to-dementia conversion and mortality risk in dementia participants. Sensitivity analyses were performed to control for confounding.ResultsHearing aid users with MCI showed a reduced risk of developing dementia both in Group 1 hazard ratio HR 0.56, 95CI, 0.45-0.69 false discovery rate FDR p .0001 and Group 3 HR,0.42 95CI, 0.27-0.66 FDR p .001.

"Exploring the potential for collaborative use of an app-based platform for n-of-1 trials among healthcare professionals that treat patients with insomnia","Background N-of-1 trials are single patient, multiple crossover, comparative effectiveness experiments. Despite their rating as level 1 evidence, they are not routinely used in clinical medicine to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments.Objective We explored the potential for implementing a mobile app-based n-of-1 trial platform for collaborative use by clinicians and patients to support data-driven decisions around the treatment of insomnia. Methods A survey assessing awareness and utilization of n-of-1 trials was administered to healthcare professionals that frequently treat patients with insomnia at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. 1M electronic health records were analyzed to evaluate evidence for a comorbid relationship between insomnia and dementia or Alzheimers disease among a patient population that may benefit from n-of-1 trials for the selection of optimal sleep treatments.  Results A total of 45 healthcare professionals completed the survey and were included in the analysis. We found that 64 of healthcare professionals surveyed had not heard of n-of-1 trials. After a brief description of these methods, 75 of healthcare professionals reported that they are likely or highly likely to use an app-based n-of-1 trial at least once in the next year if the service were free and easy to offer to their patients.  Conclusions An app-based n-of-1 trials platform might be a valuable tool for clinicians and patients to identify the best treatments for insomnia.

"Microstructural degeneration underlies executive dysfunction after stroke","Objective Executive dysfunction affects 40 of stroke patients and is associated with poor quality of life. Stroke severity and lesion volume rarely predict whether a patient will have executive dysfunction. Stroke typically occurs on a background of cerebrovascular burden, which impacts cognition and brain network structural integrity. We investigated whether measures of white matter microstructural integrity and cerebrovascular risk factors better explain executive dysfunction than markers of stroke severity. Methods We used structural equation modelling to examine multivariate relationships between cerebrovascular risk, white matter microstructural integrity fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivit,y stroke characteristics and executive dysfunction in 126 stroke patients mean age 68.4 years, three months post-stroke, and compared to 40 age- and sex-matched control participants. Executive function was measured using the Trail Making Tests, Clock Drawing task and Rey Complex Figure copy task. Microstructural integrity was estimated using a standard pipeline to process diffusion weighted images. Results Executive function was below what would be expected for age and education level in stroke patients t-test compared to controls t795.75, p0.001. A multivariate structural equation model illustrated the complex relationship between executive function, white matter integrit,y stroke characteristics and cerebrovascular risk. Pearsons correlations confirmed a stronger relationship between executive dysfunction and white matter integrit,y than executive dysfunction and stroke severity. Mediation analysis showed the relationship between executive function and white matter integrity is mediated by cerebrovascular burden. Interpretation White matter microstructural degeneration of the superior longitudinal fasciculus in the executive control network better explains executive dysfunction than markers of stroke severity.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020131v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020131v1.full.pdf",20200204,"Neurology","Veldsman","/highwire/citation/71768/bibtext",27,"060220-27","06/02/2020",71768

"Quantification of positive family history as a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease","Objective There is very little research regarding quantification of family history as a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease. This is especially so in the South Asian population, which tends to suffer from ischaemic heart disease at a much younger age, even after environmental and dietary factors are accounted for. This indicates a likely genetic basis. The aim of this study was to quantify family history as a risk factor.Methods It is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Patients with family history and hypertension as the only cardiac risk factors were recruited in the study along with control subjects. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was used for the detection of myocardial ischemia.Results 114 patients had hypertension and family history as the only risk factors. 64 of these patients had myocardial ischemia. 102 control patients were also recruited, of whom only 26 suffered from myocardial ischemia. The odds-ratio was thus calculated to be 3.69 95 CI 1.54-9.28, p0.001.Conclusions These findings suggest a strong genetic basis for ischemic heart disease in the South Asian population. This needs to be taken into consideration when such patients present with non-specific cardiac symptoms.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020560v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020560v1.full.pdf",20200206,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Iqbal","/highwire/citation/71832/bibtext",5,"070220-5","07/02/2020",71832
"The Cognitive-Functional Composite is sensitive to clinical progression in early dementia longitudinal findings from the Catch-Cog study cohort","Introduction In an attempt to capture clinically meaningful cognitive decline in early dementia, we developed the Cognitive-Functional Composite CFC. We investigated the CFCs sensitivity to decline in comparison to traditional clinical endpoints.Methods This longitudinal construct validation study included 148 participants with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. The CFC and traditional tests were administered at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Sensitivity to change was investigated using linear mixed models and R2 effect-sizes. Results CFC scores declined over time -.16,pt.001, with steepest decline observed in mild Alzheimers dementia -.25,pt.001. The CFC showed medium-to-large effect-sizes at succeeding follow-up points R2.08-.42, exhibiting greater change than the Clinical Dementia Rating scale R2.02-.12. Moreover, change on the CFC was significantly associated with informant reports of cognitive decline .38,p.001.Discussion By showing sensitivity to decline, the CFC could enhance the monitoring of disease progression in dementia research and clinical practice.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020859v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020859v1.full.pdf",20200207,"Neurology","Jutten","/highwire/citation/71863/bibtext",20,"100220-20","10/02/2020",71863
"Circular RNA and its mechanisms in diabetic retinopathy a systematic review","Circular RNAs CircRNAs are endogenous long non-coding RNAs. Unlike linear RNAs, they are structurally continuous and covalently closed, without 5 caps or 3 polyadenylation tails. High-throughput RNA sequencing has enabled people to find several endogenous circRNAs in different species and tissues. circRNA mainly acts as a sponge for microRNAs in cytoplasm to regulates protein translation, or interacts with RNA-binding proteins to generate RNA protein complexes that control transcription. circRNAs are closely associated with diseases such as diabetes, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, which indicates that circRNAs are closely related to and also play an important functional role in the occurrence and development of human diseases. Recent studies have shown that they are differentially expressed in healthy and diseased eye tissues. There lacks of biomarkers for early detection of diabetic retinopath,y and the newly discovered circRNAs seem to be an ideal candidate of novel molecular markers and therapeutic targets. However, the molecular mechanism of circRNAs activity in the occurrence and development of diabetic retinopathy are not clear yet. This systematic review aims to summarize the research status on function and mechanism of circRNAs in regulating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021204v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021204v1.full.pdf",20200211,"Ophthalmology","He","/highwire/citation/71984/bibtext",18,"170220-18","17/02/2020",71984
"Eicosanoid Inflammatory Mediators Are Robustly Associated with Blood Pressure in the General Population","Background Epidemiologic and animal studies have associated systemic inflammation with blood pressure BP. However, the mechanistic factors linking inflammation and BP remain unknown. Fatty acid derived eicosanoids serve as mediators of inflammation and have been suggested to also regulate renal vascular tone, peripheral resistance, renin-angiotensin system, and endothelial function. We therefore hypothesize that specific pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids modulate BP.Methods In N8099 FINRISK 2002 cohort participants randomly drawn from the Finnish population register 53 women, mean age 4813 years, we profiled 545 distinct high-quality eicosanoids and related oxylipin mediators in plasma using non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In models adjusted for conventional hypertension risk factors, we analyzed the associations of eicosanoids and eicosanoid profiles with systolic BP and hypertension. We used the Framingham Heart Study FHS Offspring study N2859 as the replication cohort.Results We observed 187 eicosanoids 34 significantly associated with systolic BP P  Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 0.05/545. 175 of these associations were positive and 12 were negative. Due to strong correlations between the eicosanoids, we used forward selection linear regression modeling to identify six eicosanoids independently related to systolic BP. A risk score based on these six eicosanoids was related to 40 95 confidence interval CI, 33-48 and 32 95 CI, 21-44 greater odds of hypertension in FINRISK and FHS, respectivel,y per 1-SD score increase. Individuals in the upper quartile of the six-eicosanoid risk score had 2.26-fold greater odds 95 CI, 1.96-2.62 of prevalent hypertension in FINRISK, compared with those in the lowest quartile. These findings were successfully replicated in an independent cohort of FHS participants.Conclusions Plasma eicosanoids demonstrate strong associations with BP in the general population. Intriguingl,y we observed specific protective molecules as well as harmful molecules. As eicosanoid compounds affect numerous physiological processes that are central to BP regulation, they may offer new insights regarding pathogenesis of hypertension, as well as serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021022v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021022v1.full.pdf",20200211,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Palmu","/highwire/citation/71972/bibtext",12,"170220-12","17/02/2020",71972
"Effect of Respiratory Muscle Training on Dysphagia in Stroke Patients - A Retrospective Pilot Study","Background Dysphagia is prevalent with cerebrovascular accidents and contributes to the burden of disease and mortality. Strengthening of the dysfunctional swallow muscles through respiratory muscle training RMT has proven effective in improving swallow effectiveness and safety. However, approaches to strengthen only the expiratory muscle groups EMST dominate the clinical study literature, with variable outcomes. This study investigated the effect of a simultaneous inspiratory and expiratory muscle strengthening strategy to improve swallowing function in stroke patients. Methods Twenty post-stroke patients were randomly assigned to either intervention group IG or control group CG. The intervention group was treated with three 5-minute sessions of resistive respiratory muscle training every day for 28 days, while the control group received no RMT. Respiratory and swallow outcomes were assessed pre- and post-intervention and included Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability MASA, Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing FEES with Penetration/Aspiration Scale PAS, Functional Oral Intake Scale FOIS, patient visual analogue scale VAS, and peak expiratory flow PEF. Results After 28 days, the intervention group demonstrated greater improvements pVal  0.05 in PEF IG 168.03 vs CG 17.47, VAS IG 103.85 vs CG 27.54, MASA IG 37.28 vs CG 6.92, PAS IG 69.84 vs CG 12.12, and FOIS IG 93.75 vs CG 21.21.

"Cognitive impairments in sporadic cerebral small vessel disease SVD a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohorts with stroke, dementia and non-clinical presentations of SVD","Background Cognitive impairment is a key clinical feature of cerebral small vessel disease SVD, but the full range of SVD-related cognitive impairments is unclear, and little is known about how they might vary across clinical and non-clinical manifestations of SVD.Methods In systematic searches of OVID MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO from 1st January 1985 to 6th October 2019, we identified studies reporting cognitive test results for study participants with SVD and control participants without SVD. Using standardised group-level cognitive test data, we performed random effects meta-analyses in seven cognitive domains to test whether cognitive test scores differed between SVD and control groups. We conducted meta-regression analyses to test whether differences in age, education, or vascular risk factors between SVD and control groups, or whether different clinical manifestations of SVD e.g. stroke, cognitive impairment, or non-clinical presentations accounted for cognitive effect sizes.Findings Of 8562 studies identified, we included 69 studies from six continents, published in four languages. These studies included 3229 participants with SVD and 3679 controls. Meta-analyses demonstrated that on average, control groups outperformed SVD cohorts on cognitive tests in all cognitive domains examined executive function estimate -0.928 95CI -1.08, -0.78 processing speed -0.885 -1.17, -0.60 delayed memory -0.898 -1.10, -0.69 language -0.808 -1.01, -0.60 visuospatial ability -0.720 -0.96, -0.48 reasoning -0.634 -0.93, -0.34 and attention -0.622 -0.94, -0.31 all p0.001. Meta-regression analyses suggested that differences in years of education between SVD and control groups may account for a proportion of the differences in performance on tests of executive function, visuospatial ability and language, and that cohorts with cognitive impairments performed more poorly on tests of executive function, delayed memory and visuospatial ability than cohorts with stroke or non-clinical presentations of SVD.Interpretation Participants with SVD demonstrated poorer cognitive performance relative to control groups in all cognitive domains we examined. This effect was present for all presentations of SVD, reinforcing the need to test a range of cognitive domains in both clinical and research settings. Lower levels of education in SVD versus control participants may contribute to these effects, highlighting the need to account for educational level in the assessment of SVD-related cognitive impairment.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020628v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020628v1.full.pdf",20200211,"Neurology","Hamilton","/highwire/citation/71963/bibtext",8,"170220-8","17/02/2020",71963
"Transcutaneous Cervical Vagal Nerve Stimulation Blocks Sympathetic Responses to Stress in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder","Objective Exacerbated autonomic responses to acute stress are prevalent in posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of transcutaneous cervical VNS tcVNS on autonomic responses to acute stress in patients with PTSD. The authors hypothesized tcVNS would reduce the sympathetic response to stress compared to a sham device.Methods Using a randomized double-blind approach, the effects of tcVNS on physiological responses to stress were investigated in patients with PTSD n25 using noninvasive sensing modalities. Participants received either sham or active tcVNS after exposure to acute personalized traumatic script stress and mental stress public speech, mental arithmetic over a three-day protocol. Physiological parameters related to sympathetic responses to stress were investigated.Results Relative to sham, tcVNS paired to traumatic script stress decreased sympathetic function as measured by decreased heart rate -5.6  -3.6, p0.01, increased photoplethysmogram amplitude peripheral vasodilation 30.8 -28, p0.05, and increased pulse arrival time vascular function 6.2 -1.9, p0.0001. Similar p  0.05 autonomic, cardiovascular, and vascular effects were observed when tcVNS was applied after mental stress or without acute stress.Conclusion tcVNS attenuates sympathetic arousal associated with stress related to traumatic memories as well as mental stress in patients with PTSD, with effects persisting throughout multiple traumatic stress and stimulation testing days. These findings show that tcVNS has beneficial effects on the underlying neurophysiology of PTSD. Such autonomic metrics may also be evaluated in daily life settings in tandem with tcVNS therapy to provide closed-loop delivery and measure efficacy.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021626v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021626v2.full.pdf",20200217,"Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology","Gurel","/highwire/citation/72123/bibtext",1,"180220-1","18/02/2020",72123
"A non-APOE polygenic score for Alzheimers disease and APOE-e4 have independent associations with dementia in the Health and Retirement Study","INTRODUCTION. Alzheimers disease AD is a common and costly neurodegenerative disorder. A large proportion of risk is heritable and many genetic risk factors for AD have been identified. The cumulative genetic risk of known markers has not been benchmarked for dementia in a population-based sample.METHODS. In the United States population-based Health and Retirement Study HRS waves 1995-2014, we evaluated the role of cumulative genetic risk for AD, with and without the APOE-e4 alleles, on dementia status dementia, cognitive impairment without dementia, borderline cognitive impairment without dementia, cognitively normal. We used logistic regression, accounting for demographic covariates and genetic principal components, and analyses were stratified by European and African genetic ancestry.RESULTS. In the European ancestry sample n8399, both AD polygenic score excluding the APOE genetic region odds ratio OR1.10 95 confidence interval CI 1.00, 1.20 and the presence of any APOE-e4 alleles OR2.42 95 CI 1.99, 2.95 were associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal cognition in a mutually-adjusted model. In the African ancestry sample n1605, the presence of any APOE-e4 alleles was associated with 1.77 95 CI 1.20, 2.61 times higher odds of dementia, while the AD polygenic score excluding the APOE genetic region was not significantly associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal cognition 1.06 95 CI 0.97, 1.30.DISCUSSION. Cumulative genetic risk for AD and APOE-e4 are both independent predictors of dementia. This study provides important insight into the polygenic nature of dementia and demonstrates the utility of polygenic scores in dementia research.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021667v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021667v2.full.pdf",20200211,"Epidemiology","Bakulski","/highwire/citation/72013/bibtext",35,"170220-35","17/02/2020",72013
"Isolevuglandins promote autoimmunity and hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus","Hypertension, vascular inflammation and renal inflammation are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus SLE, a multisystem autoimmune disease that is complex and poorly understood. Oxidation products of arachidonic and other fatty acids, termed isolevuglandins isoLG lead to formation of post-translational protein modifications that are immunogenic. We demonstrate isoLG enrichment in dendritic cells DCs, B cells, and plasma cells from juvenile female B6.SLE123 mice. In adult B6.SLE123 and NZBWF1 mice, isoLG adducts are enriched in plasma cells and splenic DCs compared to C57Bl/6 and NZW mice respectively. Treatment with the isoLG-scavenger 2-hydroxybenzylamine 2-HOBA reduced blood pressure, improved renal function, and attenuated renal injury. Moreover, 2-HOBA reduced bone marrow plasma cells, total IgG levels, and anti-dsDNA antibody titers. We also demonstrate that mice with SLE generate specific IgG antibodies against isoLG adducted protein, confirming the immunogenicity of isoLG adducts. Finall,y we found that isoLG adducted peptides are markedly enriched in monocytes from patients with SLE which was accompanied by an increase in superoxide production. These findings support a role of isoLG adducts in the genesis and maintenance of systemic autoimmunity and its associated hypertension in SLE. Scavenging of isoLGs promises to be a novel therapy for this disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021741v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021741v1.full.pdf",20200212,"Allergy and Immunology","Patrick","/highwire/citation/72029/bibtext",45,"170220-45","17/02/2020",72029
"Metabolomic changes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","Objective Widespread metabolic changes are seen in neurodegenerative disease and could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. They may also reveal disease mechanisms that could be a target for therapy. In this study we looked for blood-based biomarkers in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Methods Plasma metabolomic profiles were measured from 134 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia n30, non fluent variant primary progressive aphasia n26, progressive supranuclear palsy n45, corticobasal syndrome n33 and 32 healthy controls.Results Forty-nine of 842 metabolites were significantly altered in frontotemporal lobar degeneration after false-discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. These were distributed across a wide range of metabolic pathways including amino acids, energy and carbohydrate, cofactor and vitamin, lipid and nucleotide pathways. The metabolomic profile supported classification between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and controls with high accuracy 88.1-96.6 while classification accuracy was lower between the frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes 72.1-83.3. One metabolic profile, comprising a range of different pathways, was consistently identified as a feature of each disease versus controls the degree to which a patient expressed this metabolomic profile was associated with their subsequent survival hazard ratio 0.74 0.59-0.93, p0.0018. Conclusions The metabolic changes in FTLD are promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Further work is required to replicate these findings, examine longitudinal change, and test their utility in differentiating between FTLD syndromes that are pathologically distinct but phenotypically similar.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021758v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021758v1.full.pdf",20200212,"Neurology","Murley","/highwire/citation/72030/bibtext",46,"170220-46","17/02/2020",72030
"Predicting loss of independence and mortality in frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, behavioural impairment predicts loss of functional independence and motor clinical features predict mortalit,y irrespective of syndrome subtype. MethodWe used a transdiagnostic approach to survival in an epidemiological cohort, testing the association between clinical features, independence and survival in patients with clinical diagnoses of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia n64, non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia n36, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia n25, progressive supranuclear palsy n101 and corticobasal syndrome n68. A principal components analysis identified six dimensions of clinical features. Using Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression we identified the association between each of these dimensions and functionally independent survival time from clinical assessment to care home admission, and absolute survival time to death. Analyses adjusted for the covariates of age, gender and diagnostic group. Secondary analysis excluded specific diagnostic groups.ResultsBehavioural disturbance, including impulsivity and apath,y was associated with reduced functionally independent survival OR 2.46, p0.001, even if patients with bvFTD were removed from the analysis. Motor impairments were associated with reduced absolute survival, even if patients with PSP and CBS were removed from the analysis.ConclusionOur results may help individualised prognostication and planning of disease-modifying trials and support a transdiagnostic approach to symptomatic treatment trials in patients with clinical syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022061v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022061v1.full.pdf",20200212,"Neurology","Murley","/highwire/citation/72045/bibtext",56,"170220-56","17/02/2020",72045
"Alzheimers disease susceptibility gene apolipoprotein e APOE and blood biomarkers in UK Biobank N395,769.","Background and objective Alzheimers disease AD is a neurodegenerative condition where the underlying aetiology is still unclear. Investigating the potential influence of apolipoprotein APOE, a major genetic risk factor, on common blood biomarkers could provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms of AD and dementia risk. Our objective was to conduct the largest to date single-protocol investigation of blood biomarkers in the context of APOE genotype, in UK Biobank.Methods After quality control and exclusions, data on 395,769 participants of White European ancestry were available for analysis. Linear regressions were used to test potential associations between APOE genotypes and biomarkers.Results Several biomarkers significantly associated with APOE e4 risk and e2 protective genotypes vs. neutral e3/e3. Most associations supported previous data for example, e4 genotype was associated with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL standardized beta b  0.150 standard deviations SDs per allele, p0.001 and e2 with lower LDL b  -0.456 SDs, p0.001. There were however instances of associations found in unexpected directions e.g. e4 and increased insulin-like growth factor IGF-1 standardized beta  0.017, p0.001 where lower levels have been previously suggested as an AD risk factor. Conclusions These findings highlight biomarker differences in non-demented people at genetic risk for dementia.

The majority of patients with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder iRBD develop PD or DLB later in life, suggesting that iRBD is a prodromal phase of these two conditions. In the current study we aimed to evaluate the role of SMPD1 variants in iRBD. SMPD1 and its untranslated regions were sequenced using targeted next-generation sequencing in 959 iRBD patients and 1,287 controls from European descent. Logistic regression adjusted for sex and age showed no significant associations with two common variants and iRBD rs1050239 and rs8164.

"Expression profiles of circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs in extreme phenotypes of diabetic retinopathy","Recent evidences highlighted regulatory role of circular RNAs circRNAs and long non-coding RNAs lncRNAs in the development of diabetic retinopathy DR. However, the literatures and number of the RNAs identified were limited. Here, we compared the expression profiles of circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs in the blood of the susceptible individuals who developed severe DR within 5 years after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetic mellitus T2DM, and the inherently resistant individuals who are spared from DR despite over 20-year history of T2DM. Using RNA microarra,y hundreds of significantly differently expressed circRNAs, lncRNAs, and dozens of mRNAs were identified. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction verified the above findings. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the differentially expressed circRNAs were involved in platelet-derived growth factor binding, and mRNA and the cis-target genes of lncRNA participate in negative regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis suggested that the differentially expressed circRNAs were related to vitamin B6 metabolism and type 2 diabetes. The cis-target genes of lncRNAs are enriched in valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis and in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling pathway. The trans-target genes of lncRNAs are enriched in pathways such as vitamin B6 metabolism. Differentially expressed mRNAs are associated with type 2 diabetes and the vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that circRNAs and lncRNAs may be involved in the regulation of DR and lay a foundation for further researches into the underlying mechanisms.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023481v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023481v1.full.pdf",20200220,"Ophthalmology","Zhou","/highwire/citation/72262/bibtext",11,"210220-11","21/02/2020",72262

This population-based cohort includes a total of 502,602 individuals aged between 40 and 96 years old at baseline who were recruited between 2006 to 2010.Exposures Genetic variants robustly associated with the expression of target genes in whole blood based on P5x10-08 were used to construct gene scores using findings from the eQTLGen consortium n31,684.Main Outcomes and Measures Genetically predicted effects for each of the 8,851 genes were firstly evaluated with 5 measured outcomes from the UK Biobank in turn body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides. Effects surviving multiple comparisons from this initial analysis were subsequently analyzed using factorial Mendelian randomization to evaluate evidence of an additive beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease risk compared to a HMGCR genetic score acting as a proxy for statin inhibition. Finall,y a phenome-wide analysis was undertaken to evaluate predicted effects between prioritized targets and 570 outcomes in the UK Biobank to highlight potential adverse side-effects.Results 377 genetically predicted effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors were identified by Mendelian randomization based on P1.13x10-6. Of the 68 druggable genes, 20 candidate genes were predicted to lower cardiovascular disease risk in combination with statin treatment P7.35x10-4. Genes such as FDFT1 were predicted to have added benefit with statin therapy OR0.93 95 CI, 0.91-0.95 P2.21x10-10 but are unlikely to make safe targets due to their predicted effects on adverse side effects.

We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19.Methods This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined.Findings Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days range, 4 to 30 days follow-up period, 31 patients 28.4 died, while 78 71.6 survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 48.6 developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years, and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes 20.8 vs. 1.8, cerebrovascular disease 11.3 vs. 0, and chronic kidney disease 15.1 vs. 3.6. Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS.Interpretation The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactor,y which needs more attention from clinicians.

"Leading causes of mortality and prescription drug coverage in Canada and New Zealand","Background Canada may soon see the introduction of a national pharmaceutical insurance system. New Zealand has a government-funded healthcare system used by all residents that operates within a tight cost-containment budget. Objective To compare the main mortality causes in Canada and New Zealand and examine listings in current Canadian provincial public drug plans and the New Zealand national drug formulary. Methods Age-standardized mortality rates from 1985 to 2014 and data on hospital discharges and average length of stay in hospital for Canada and New Zealand were obtained from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developments website. Information on insured medications was obtained from Canadian provincial drug plan lists and the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Schedule current in mid-2019. Results Mortality rates for acute myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were higher, on average over the 30-year observation period, in New Zealand, but rates for malignancies and respiratory disorders were similar in the two countries. Reimbursement listing rates for drugs for cancer and some cardiovascular indications were lower in New Zealand than in Canada. Conclusions New Zealands drug coverage system has contained costs, but it restricts or denies access to new innovative medicines with the potential to improve patients lives. Although a New Zealand-style national pharmacare scheme in Canada would offer the opportunity to restrain drug expenditure, it would likely fail to satisfy patients and healthcare providers and diminish health outcomes, resulting in higher costs in other healthcare sectors.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024232v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024232v2.full.pdf",20200220,"Health Policy","Rawson","/highwire/citation/72340/bibtext",41,"210220-41","21/02/2020",72340
"Is glycaemia associated with poorer brain health and risk of dementia? Cross sectional and follow-up analysis of the UK Biobank","Objective To understand the relationship across the glycaemic spectrum with incident dementia, brain structure, and cognitive decline.Research Design and Methods UK Biobank participants, aged 40-69 at recruitment. HbA1c and diabetes diagnosis define baseline glycaemic categories. Outcomes included incident vascular dementia VD, Alzheimers dementia AD, hippocampal volume HV, white matter hyperintensity WMH volume, cognitive function and decline. All results are in reference to normoglycaemic individuals HbA1c 35-42 mmol/mol. Results 210433 47, 15246 3, 3280 0.7, 20793 5 individuals had low HbA1c, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes, respectively.  Pre- and known diabetes markedly increased incident VD, hazard ratios HR 1.51, 95CI1.012.25 and 1.96, 95CI1.492.58, respectivel,y less so AD 1.18, 0.921.52 and 1.13 0.95,1.33, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic variables. For VD, multivariate adjustment, driven by antihypertensives, attenuated associations, HR 1.27, 0.841.91 and 1.45,1.071.97. Pre- and known diabetes conferred elevated risks of cognitive decline odds ratio OR 1.53, 1.022.29 and 1.49, 1.022.18, respectively. People with pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and known diabetes had higher WMH volumes 4, 30, 3, respectivel,y and lower HV 34.51 mm3, 11.73 mm3 and 61.13 mm3 respectively. People with low-normal HbA1c 35 mmol/mol had 5 lower WMH volume and 13.6 mm3 greater HV than normoglycaemic individuals.  Conclusions Pre and known diabetes increase VD risks, less so AD.  Excess VD risks were largely accounted for by treated hypertension. Hyperglycaemic states were associated with adverse, whereas low normal HbA1c was associated with favourable brain structure compared to normoglycaemic individuals. Our findings have implications for cardiovascular medication in hyperglycaemia for brain health.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024471v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024471v2.full.pdf",20200221,"Epidemiology","Garfield","/highwire/citation/72362/bibtext",7,"230220-7","23/02/2020",72362

DESIGNRetrospective case seriesSETTINGThree designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China.PARTICIPANTSTwo hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESClinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories central nervous system CNS symptoms or diseases headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epileps,y peripheral nervous system PNS symptoms hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia, and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists.RESULTSOf 214 patients studied, 88 41.1 were severe and 126 58.9 were non-severe patients.

"Polygenic modulation of lipoproteina-associated cardiovascular risk","Aims Elevated levels of lipoproteina are one of the strongest inherited risk factors for coronary artery disease CAD. However, there is variability in cardiovascular risk among individuals with elevated lipoproteina. The sources of this variability are incompletely understood. We assessed the effects of a genomic risk score GRS for CAD on risk of myocardial infarction among individuals with elevated lipoproteina.Methods We calculated CAD GRSs for 408,896 individuals of British white ancestry from the UK Biobank using 6.27 million common genetic variants. Lipoproteina levels were measured in 310,020 individuals. The prevalence and risk of myocardial infarction versus CAD GRS percentiles were compared for individuals with and without elevated lipoproteina defined as 120 or 168 nmol/L 50 or 70 mg/dL, respectively. Results Individuals with elevated lipoproteina displayed significantly greater CAD GRSs than individuals without elevated lipoproteina, which was largely dependent on the influence of genetic variants within or near the LPA gene. Continuous levels of CAD GRS percentile were significantly associated with risk of myocardial infarction for individuals with elevated lipoproteina. Notabl,y the risk of myocardial infarction for males with elevated lipoproteina levels, but a CAD GRS percentile in the lower quintile 20th percentile, was less than the overall risk of myocardial infarction for males with non-elevated lipoproteina levels hazard ratio 95 CI 0.79 0.64-0.97, p0.02. Similar results were observed for females.Conclusion These data suggest that CAD genomic scores influence cardiovascular risk among individuals with elevated lipoproteina and may aid in identifying candidates for preventive therapies.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026757v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026757v1.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Trinder","/highwire/citation/72614/bibtext",42,"270220-42","27/02/2020",72614
"Evidence of accelerated epigenetic aging in patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease Results of the LipidCardio study","DNA methylation DNAm age acceleration, defined as the deviation of chronological and epigenetic age determined by an epigenetic clock, has been proposed as a biomarker of biological aging. To address the above hypothesis in the context of cardiovascular disease, we evaluated whether patients N827, mean chronological age 69.82/-11.01 years, DNAm age 71.91/-16.11, residual DNAm age acceleration 0.00/-9.65 years, who were diagnosed with obstructive coronary artery disease CAD by coronary angiography were aged prematurel,y i.e. had an increase in the DNAm age acceleration, in comparison with patients for whom obstructive CAD was ruled out controls.Stratified analysis yielded a significant acceleration in DNAm age determined by a seven cytosine-phosphate-guanine epigenetic clock in patients diagnosed with obstructive CAD, defined by at least one 50 coronary stenosis N588, rDNA age acceleration0.58/-9.47, corrected p 2.05x10-3 compared to control subjects N145, residual rDNAm age acceleration -3.11/-10.51 years. Moreover, rDNAm age acceleration was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure beta0.069, 95 CI 0.027 - 0.112, p 1.44x10-3, sex beta-2.438, 95 CI -4.591 - -0.285, p 2.65x10-2, estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR, beta0.040, 95 CI 0.011 - 0.069, p 6.87x10-9 and smoking status beta-8.538, 95 CI -10.772 - -6.303, p 2,45x10-13.  Across studies, assessing CAD and its risk factors in the context of epigenetic age acceleration findings are remarkably inconclusive. While the here employed seven-cytosine-phosphate-guanine epigenetic clock suggests premature biological aging in CAD patients, compared to controls without coronary stenosis, its association with cardiovascular risk factors was limited.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026906v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026906v1.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Banszerus","/highwire/citation/72565/bibtext",16,"270220-16","27/02/2020",72565
"Fasting alters the gut microbiome with sustained blood pressure and body weight reduction in metabolic syndrome patients","Periods of fasting and refeeding may reduce cardiometabolic risk elevated by Western diet. We show that in hypertensive metabolic syndrome MetS patients n35, a 5-day fast followed by a modified DASH diet Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension reduced systolic blood pressure SBP, antihypertensive medication need, and body-mass index BMI at three months post intervention compared to a modified DASH diet alone n36. Fasting altered the gut microbiome, impacting bacterial taxa and gene modules associated with short-chain fatty acid production. Cross-system analyses revealed a positive correlation of circulating mucosa-associated invariant T MAIT cells, non-classical monocytes and CD4 effector T cells with SBP. Furthermore, regulatory T cells Tregs positively correlated with BMI and weight. Machine learning could predict sustained SBP-responsiveness within the fasting group from baseline immunome data, identifying CD8 effector T cells, Th17 cells and Tregs as important contributors to the model. The high-resolution multi-omics data highlights fasting as a promising non-pharmacological intervention in MetS.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20027029v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20027029v1.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Balogh","/highwire/citation/72574/bibtext",21,"270220-21","27/02/2020",72574
"Dermal trypanosomes in suspected and confirmed cases of gambiense Human African Trypanosomiasis.","BackgroundThe diagnosis of Human African Trypanosomiasis HAT typically involves two steps a serological screen, followed by the detection of living trypanosome parasites in the blood or lymph node aspirate. Live parasites can, however, remain undetected in some seropositive individuals, who we hypothesize are infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense parasites in their extravascular dermis.Methods and findingsTo test this hypothesis, we conducted a prospective observational cohort study in the gambiense HAT gHAT focus of Forecariah, in the Republic of Guinea. 5,417 subjects in this disease foci underwent serological screening for gHAT. Of these individuals, 66 were enrolled into our stud,y of whom 40 were seronegative, 8 were seropositive but unconfirmed, and 18 confirmed gHAT cases. Enrolled individuals underwent a dermatological examination, and had blood samples and skin biopsies taken and examined for trypanosomes by molecular and immuno-histological methods. In confirmed cases, dermatological symptoms were significantly more frequent, relative to seronegative controls. T. b. gambiense parasites were present in the blood of all confirmed cases but not in unconfirmed seropositive individuals. However, trypanosomes were detected in the dermis of all unconfirmed seropositive individuals and confirmed cases. After 6 and 20 months of treatment, dermal trypanosome numbers in skin biopsies of confirmed cases progressively reduced. ConclusionsOur results thus highlight the skin as a potential reservoir for trypanosomes, with implications for our understanding of this diseases epidemiology in the context of its planned elimination and highlighting the skin as a novel target for gHAT diagnostics.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026211v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026211v1.full.pdf",20200225,"Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","Camara","/highwire/citation/72587/bibtext",26,"270220-26","27/02/2020",72587
"Clinical and radiographic features of cardiac injury in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia","Objective To investigate the correlation between clinical characteristics and cardiac injury of COVID-2019 pneumonia. Methods In this retrospective, single-center stud,y 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 COVID-2019 patients including 2 deaths of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue EAT has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019.ResultsOf the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 4.88, 32 78.05, 4 9.75 and 3 7.32 patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 24.4 patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. Conclusion Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients.

"2019 novel coronavirus disease in hemodialysis HD patients Report from one HD center in Wuhan, China","The outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan has become a global epidemic of contagious diseases, which poses a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with underlined diseases. However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiolog,y clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of  T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v2.full.pdf",20200227,"Nephrology","Ma","/highwire/citation/72768/bibtext",118,"270220-118","27/02/2020",72768
"Estimation of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality - preliminary results","Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender.  Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics.We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortalit,y where 60 or older patients have an OR  18.8161 CI957.1997 41.5517. Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest OR12.8328 CI9510.2736 15.8643, along with chronic respiratory disease OR7.7925 CI955.5446 10.4319. Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 OR1.8518 CI951.5996 2.1270. Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. A final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027268v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027268v1.full.pdf",20200225,"Epidemiology","Caramelo","/highwire/citation/72551/bibtext",9,"270220-9","27/02/2020",72551
"microRNA signatures of perioperative myocardial injury after elective non-cardiac surgery prospective observational cohort study","Background Elevated plasma/serum troponin, indicating perioperative myocardial injury PMI, is common after non-cardiac surgery. However, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Acute coronary syndrome ACS is associated with the early appearance of circulating microRNAs, which regulate post-translational gene expression.

Severe cases accounted for 16.0 of the study population. 131 8.2 patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 25.1 reported having at least one comorbidity. 269 16.9, 59 3.7, 30 1.9, 130 8.2, 28 1.8, 24 1.5, 21 1.3, 18 1.1 and 3 0.2 patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficienc,y respectively. 130 8.2 patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidit,y and even more so as compared with those without all P0.05. After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with COPD HR 2.681, 95CI 1.424-5.048, diabetes HR 1.59, 95CI 1.03-2.45, hypertension HR 1.58, 95CI 1.07-2.32 and malignancy HR 3.50, 95CI 1.60-7.64 were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. As compared with patients without comorbidit,y the HR 95CI was 1.79 95CI 1.16-2.77 among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 95CI 1.61-4.17 among patients with two or more comorbidities.Conclusion Comorbidities are present in around one fourth of patients with COVID-19 in China, and predispose to poorer clinical outcomes.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027664v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027664v1.full.pdf",20200227,"Respiratory Medicine","Guan","/highwire/citation/72711/bibtext",86,"270220-86","27/02/2020",72711
"Clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19","Background A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospitals electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male 65.9. More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years 80.5 and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity 76.8, including hypertension 56.1, heart disease 20.7, diabetes 18.3, cerebrovascular disease 12.2, and cancer 7.3. Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death 69.5, following by sepsis syndrome/MOF 28.0, cardiac failure 14.6, hemorrhage 6.1, and renal failure 3.7. Furthermore, respirator,y cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100, 89, 80.5, 78.0, and 31.7 of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia 89.2, neutrophilia 74.3, and thrombocytopenia 24.3 were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of 5 94.5, high systemic immune-inflammation index of 500 89.2, increased C-reactive protein level 100, lactate dehydrogenase 93.2, and D-dimer 97.1. A high level of IL-6 10 pg/ml was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days IQR 11-20, and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase p0.002, alanine aminotransferase p0.037 and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191v1.full.pdf",20200227,"Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","Zhang","/highwire/citation/72713/bibtext",88,"270220-88","27/02/2020",72713
"Clinical characteristics of 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","BackgroundAlthough the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19.MethodsFor this retrospective, single-center stud,y we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laborator,y radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. ResultsWe included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years SD 9.64, range 50-90. 2569.44 patients were males, and 11 30.56 female. 26 72.22 patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever 34 94.44 patients, cough 28 77.78 patients, shortness of breath 21 58.33 patients, and fatigue 17 47.22 patient. Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 96.88 patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients 70.59, decreased albumin 30.18, SD, 4.76 in 25 patients 80.65, elevated D-dimer 8.64 IQR, 2.39-20 in 27 patients 100, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase 502.5 U/L IQR, 410-629 in 26 patients 100. Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP 106.3 mg/L IQR, 60.83-225.3, PCT 0.61 ng/ml IQR, 0.16-2.10 and IL-6 100.6 pg/ml IQR, 51.51-919.5. Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therap,y and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy 25 69.44. All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days.  One 2.78 patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days.InterpretationLots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009v2.full.pdf",20200305,"Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","Huang","/highwire/citation/73030/bibtext",40,"060320-40","06/03/2020",73030
"Association of Cardiovascular Manifestations with In-hospital Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 A Hospital Staff Data","Background The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 remain a huge threat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19.Aims This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations CVMs with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laborator,y radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs.Results Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5, while 87.8 of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 - 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever 82.9, myalgia or fatigue 80.5 and cough 63.4. While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue 80.5, fever 73.2 and cough 41.5. There were 95.1 cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5 and 41.5, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count 0.99 - 0.43 and 1.55 - 0.61, P0.001, more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission 50.0 and 11.8, P0.011, and more received oxygen support 79.2 and 23.5, P0.001. The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group 75.0 and 23.5, P0.001. Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events.Conclusions Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348v5","/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348v5.full.pdf",20200312,"Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","Liu","/highwire/citation/73408/bibtext",4,"130320-4","13/03/2020",73408
"Polygenic Risk Score Modifies Risk of Coronary Artery Disease Conferred by Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol","An individuals lifetime risk of Coronary Artery Disease CAD is determined by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Whilst adherence to a healthy lifestyle can help individuals with high genetic risk reduce their lifetime risk of CAD, the extent to which blood lipid levels affect CAD risk in individuals with varying genetic risk remains unknown. To explore how genetics, blood lipids and CAD risk interact, we derived a novel genome-wide polygenic risk score PRS for CAD. We then applied the PRS to individuals from the UK Biobank and divided them into Low PRS bottom 10 percentiles of PRS distribution, Intermediate PRS PRS in the 10th-90th percentiles, and High PRS top 10 percentiles, and further stratified individuals by blood lipid levels.We found that the elevated CAD risk conferred by high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C was modified by the interaction with PRS P-value interaction 0.005. Individuals with High PRS and whose LDL-C was Borderline between 130 and 160 mg/dL had higher CAD relative risk HR 3.10 95 CI, 2.55-3.76 than those at Intermediate PRS whose LDL-C were Very High 190 mg/dL HR 2.77 95 CI, 2.33-3.28. Furthermore, individuals with High PRS but whose lipid levels were below the following thresholds did not have a significantly increased risk for incident CAD LDL-C 130 mg/dL, total Cholesterol TC 200 mg/dL, LDL-CHDL 2.0 and TCHDL 3.0. In addition, individuals with Low PRS and Very High LDL-C 190 mg/dl did not have increased CAD risk, which was comparable to individuals with Intermediate PRS and Optimal LDL-C 130 mg/dL.Our results have important implications for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease. Currentl,y healthy individuals with Borderline LDL-C 130-159 mg/dL are not considered to be at high risk of CAD. Here we demonstrate that the combination of Borderline LDL-C and High PRS results in CAD relative risk which is greater than individuals without high polygenic risk, but whose LDL-C levels are high enough for statins to be recommended 190 mg/dL. This analysis therefore demonstrates that PRS can identify a proportion of the population who are at high-risk of CAD but who are invisible to current approaches for assessing CAD risk. Moreover, of perhaps greater significance is the evidence that individuals who have a combination of High PRS and Optimal blood lipid levels do not have greater risk of CAD than individuals without high polygenic risk and the same Optimal blood lipid levels. Our results suggest that high polygenic risk for CAD could be overcome by controlling blood lipid levels. We propose that incorporating PRS into CAD risk assessment early in life could allow individuals at high polygenic risk to benefit from tailored blood lipid guidelines and avoid lifetime exposure to potentially damaging PRS-dependent LDL-C levels.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029454v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029454v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Bolli","/highwire/citation/73031/bibtext",41,"060320-41","06/03/2020",73031
"High Density Lipoprotein pathway as a therapeutic target for coronary heart disease individual participant meta-analysis in 28,597 individuals with 4197 coronary events","Importance Cholesterol content in high-density lipoprotein particles HDL-C is associated inversely with coronary heart disease CHD, but findings from Mendelian randomization studies and randomized trials of HDL-C raising drugs have questioned whether this link is causal.  However, these analyses do not exclude a causal role for specific HDL sub-fractions of different densit,y mobilit,y size and composition. Objective To determine whether sub-components of the HDL pathway exhibit differing relationships with CHD risk.Design In seven longitudinal studies, we used factor analysis to reduce 21 measures of HDL particle size and lipid content to a smaller number of factors representing different components of the HDL pathway. We constructed factor scores and modelled their associations on CHD risk in adjusted Cox regression analyses. We pooled results using random-effects meta-analysis.Setting Seven population-, individual-, occupational- or community-based longitudinal studies in the UK and Finland.Participants 28,597 participants 49 female, mean age 59.6 years contributed to the analysis.Exposures Sub-components of the HDL pathwa,y characterized by 21 measures of HDL size and lipid content based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Main Outcomes Incident fatal or non-fatal CHD.Results We identified 4 HDL components with highly replicable across studies 3 were indices of particle size/composition extra-large XL, large L and medium/small MS, and the other an index of triglycerides TG carried in HDL of all sizes. After up to 17 years of follow-up, 4179 incident CHD cases occurred. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicit,y smoking, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes and LDL-C, higher levels of the XL and MS factors were linked to a reduced risk of CHD hazard ratio per 1 standard deviation SD increase 0.88 95 CI 0.85, 0.92 and 0.91 0.87, 0.94. In contrast, a SD increase in the level of the TG factor was associated with increased risk of CHD 1.10 1.07, 1.14.Conclusions and Relevance We found qualitative differences between sub-components of the HDL pathway and the risk of developing CHD. Discovery of the biological determinants of these components, possibly through genetic analysis, will facilitate selection of drug targets and inform trial design.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.19010173v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.19010173v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Mulick","/highwire/citation/73174/bibtext",36,"070320-36","07/03/2020",73174
"Key Points of Clinical and CT Imaging Features of 2019 Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Imported Pneumonia Based On 21 Cases Analysis","Background and Objective WHO Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,and the outbreak is still on-going.Chest CT had been a key component of the diagnostic workup for patients with suspected infection. In this retrospective stud,y we attempt to summarize and analyze the chest CT features of 2019-nCov infections, and to identify the typical features to improved the diagnostic accuracy of new coronavirus pneumonia NCP. MethodsChest CT scans and Clinical data of 21 patients confirmed NCP in our hospital were enrolled.These patients were divided into mild and sever group according to clinical manifestations described by the 6th clinical practice guideline of NCP in China. Main clinical and chest CT features were analyzed and identify. Results Fever 85.7 and cough 80.9 were the two main symptoms of NCP patients.More significantly higher incidence 85.7 of shortness of breath in the severe cases. Multiple lesions in both lungs and with incidence of GGO100,vascular enlargement 76.5 and cobblestone/reticular pattern70.6 were the major feature.The incidence of consolidation, mixed pattern and vascular enlargement features were up to 100 in the severe group, significantly higher than that of patients in mild group. In addition, the incidence of air-bronchogram, dilated bronchi with thickened wall and fibrosis in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the mild group. Conclusions Fever and cough are the typical clinical features of NCP patients, and chest CT mainly manifested as multiple lesions in both lungs, often accompanied by GGO, vascular enlargement and cobblestone/reticular pattern.Changes in these main CT features can indicate development of the disease.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030775v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030775v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Radiology and Imaging","Wu","/highwire/citation/73091/bibtext",61,"060320-61","06/03/2020",73091
"How to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from heart failure with computed tomography at initial medical contact during epidemic period","OBJECTIVES To compare chest CT findings in heart failure with those of Corona Virus Disease 2019 COVID-19 pneumonia.BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography CT has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated.METHODS Patients with heart failure n12, COVID-19 pneumonia n12 and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed.

"Prediction of Venous Thromboembolism Based on Clinical and Genetic Factors","BACKGROUND Both clinical and genetic factors drive the risk of venous thromboembolism. However, whether clinically recorded risk factors and genetic variants can be combined into a clinically applicable predictive score remains unknown. METHODS Using Cox proportional-hazard models, we analyzed the association of risk factors with the likelihood of venous thromboembolism in U.K. Biobank, a large prospective cohort. We created a novel ten point clinical score using seven established clinical risk factors for venous thromboembolism. We also generated a polygenic risk score of 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms to quantify genetic risk. The genetic score was categorized into high risk top two deciles of scores, intermediate risk deciles three to eight, and low risk lowest two deciles. The discrete clinical score led to the following approximate decile categorizations high risk 5 to 10 points, intermediate risk 3 to 4 points, and low risk 0 to 2 points. RESULTS Amongst the 502,536 participants in the U.K. Biobank, there were 4,843 events of venous thromboembolism. Analyses of established clinical risk factors and the most commonly used medications revealed that participants were at decreased risk of venous thromboembolism if they had ever used oral contraceptive pills hazard ratio, 0.88 95 confidence interval CI, 0.79 to 0.99 or if they currently used bendroflumethiazide hazard ratio, 0.84 95 CI, 0.74 to 0.95, cod liver oil capsules hazard ratio, 0.87 95 CI, 0.77 to 0.99, or atenolol hazard ratio, 0.79 95 CI, 0.68 to 0.91. Participants were at significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism if they were at high clinical risk hazard ratio, 5.98 95 CI, 5.43 to 6.59 or high genetic risk hazard ratio, 2.28 95 CI, 2.07 to 2.51 relative to participants at low clinical or genetic risk, respectively. Combining clinical risk factors with genetic risk factors produced a model that better predicted risk of venous thromboembolism than either model alone P0.001.  Participants at high clinical and genetic risk in the combined score had over an eightfold increased risk of venous thromboembolism relative to participants at low risk hazard ratio, 8.27 95 CI 7.59 to 9.00.CONCLUSIONS  By assessing venous thromboembolic events in over 500,000 participants, we identified several known and novel associations between risk factors and venous thromboembolism. Participants in the high risk group of a combined score, consisting of clinical and genetic factors, were over eight times more likely to experience venous thromboembolism than participants in the low risk group.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031054v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031054v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Kolin","/highwire/citation/73082/bibtext",58,"060320-58","06/03/2020",73082
"Acute Myocardial Injury of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019","Background Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID-19 in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidit,y acute myocardial injury AMI in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them.Methods We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients 28 men, 25 women age, 19-81 years. We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests including cardiac injury biomarkers, echocardiograph,y electrocardiograph,y imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 79.25 patients tachycardia n15, electrocardiography abnormities n11, diastolic dysfunction n20, elevated myocardial enzymes n30, and AMI n6. All the six AMI patients were aged 60 years five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Novel coronavirus pneumonia NCP severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI p0.001. All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein CRP levels, NCP severit,y and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.Conclusions Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients.

"Exploration the Standard diagnosis and treatment in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in a tertiary first-class hospital in Fujian Province","Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and clinical practice of guideline for prevention and treatment of Type 2 diabetes in China among the physicians. We took a tertiary first-class hospital in Fujian Province as an example to identify the differences between clinical practice and guideline.Methods  We selected 3000 inpatients with type 2 diabetes who visited at the tertiary first-class hospital in Fujian Province between September 2017 to November 2017,then retrospectively analyzed their clinical data, including  age, gender, height, weight, body mess index, admission departments, combined diseases, complications, course of disease, diabetes diet education, monitoring of blood glucose and blood pressure, the selection of hypoglycemic therapy and other secondary prevention measures .The data we obtained was analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software.Results  A total of 3000 effective inpatient were enrolledincluding 1724 male and 1276 female, the mean age of  patients was 66 years old ,the mean hospitalization days was 12 days. In this stud,y we found that1.only 60.9 of the patients have monitored HbA1C in nearly 3 months in the last year, 96.3 of patients have monitored blood lipid98.1 of patients have monitored the serum creatinine only 9.5 of patients have received comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist.2.After admission,73.3 of patients have received the education about diabetes diet 86.8 of patients have accepted the peripheral blood glucose monitoring among 2084 diabetic patients combined with hypertension, only 1868 patients 89.6 have received blood pressure monitoring.3. Among 202 patients who are newly diagnosed diabetes, there were 45 cases meet HbA1C  9.0 or FPG  11.1 mmol/ L, only 25 people 55.56 have received an intensive insulin therapy.4.Among 474 patients who have undergone an large or medium-sized surgical treatment, about 182 62.1 patients have started a hypoglycemic therapy before the operation, and only 196 41.4 patients have changed into intensive insulin therapy before surgery. 5. About 714 of diabetic patients who combined with a clear history of cardiovascular, only 548 76.8 patients have received antiplatelet therapy and 566 people 79.3 have used statin to lower blood lipid .6.In total, only 1685.6 patients have received a relatively standard diagnosis and treatment in non-surgical department, and only 40.1 patients in surgical department.Conclusion  There are still many deficiencies in clinical practice of type 2 diabetes guideline, even in tertiary first-class hospital ,there are also many physicians, especially non-specialist doctors, were not familiar with the knowledge of guideline for management of Type 2 diabetes. The acute exacerbation of diabetes in the global can take serious complications and bring heavy economic burden, so it required us to pay attention to the prevention and early treatment of diabetes.

We considered 156 metabolomic traits individuall,y jointly as principal components PCs explaining 95 of the variance in the NMR platform, and assessed whether the PCs for the metabolic traits added to the proportion of the association explained by established cardiovascular risk factors systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein, and glucose.Results A 1kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a 0.70 g/m2.7 0.53, 0.88 and 0.66 g/m2.7 0.53, 0.79 higher LVMI in males N437 and females N536, respectively. Established risk factors explained 3 95 CI 2 to 5 of this association in males, increasing to 10 95 CI 8, 13 when including metabolic PCs. In females, the standard risk factors explained 3 95 CI 2, 5 of the association, and did not increase when including the metabolic PCs.Conclusion The addition of the NMR measured metabolic traits appear to mediate more of the effect of BMI on LVMI than the established risk factors alone in adolescent males, but not females.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033324v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033324v1.full.pdf",20200310,"Epidemiology","Carter","/highwire/citation/73320/bibtext",18,"110320-18","11/03/2020",73320
"Utilization of Electronic Health Records for the Assessment of Adiponectin Receptor Autoantibodies during the Progression of Cardio-metabolic Comorbidities","BACKGROUND Diabetes is a complex, multi-symptomatic disease that drives healthcare costs through its complications as the prevalence of this disease grows rapidly world-wide. Real-world electronic health records EHRs coupled with patient biospecimens, biological understanding, and technologies can lead to identification of new diagnostic markers.METHODS We analyzed the 20-year EHRs of 1862 participants with midpoint samples 10-year in an observational study of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular arterial disease CVAD conducted by the Fairbanks Institute to test the diagnostic biomarkers. Participants were assigned to four cohorts health,y diabetes, CVAD, CVADdiabetes based on EHR data analysis. The immunoassay reference range for circulating autoantibodies against the C terminal fragment of adiponectin receptor 1 IgG-CTF was determined and used to predict outcomes post-sample. RESULTS The IgG-CTF reference range was determined 75-821 ng/mL and out-of-range values of IgG-CTF values predicted increased likelihood of additional comorbidities and mortality determined from the EHRs 10 years after sample collection. The probability of mortality was lower in patients with elevated IgG-CTF 821 ng/mL OR 0.49-0.0 and higher in patients with lowered IgG-CTF 75 ng/mL OR 3.74-9.64.

"Dose-dependent oral glucocorticoid cardiovascular risk in people with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases","BACKGROUNDEvidence for the association between glucocorticoid dose and cardiovascular risk is weak for moderate and low doses. To quantify glucocorticoid dose-dependent cardiovascular risk in people with six immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.METHODS AND FINDINGSPopulation-based cohort analysis of medical records from 389 primary care practices contributing data to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to hospital admissions and deaths in 1998-2017. There were 87,794 patients with giant cell arteritis and/or polymyalgia rheumatica n25,581, inflammatory bowel disease n27,739, rheumatoid arthritis n25,324, systemic lupus erythematosus n3951, and/or vasculitis n5199 and no prior cardiovascular disease CVD. Mean age was 56 years and 34.1 were men. Median follow-up time was 5.0 years. Time-variant daily and cumulative glucocorticoid prednisolone-equivalent dose-related risks and hazard ratios of first all-cause and type-specific CVD.We found 13,426 15.3 people with incident CVD, including 6,013 atrial fibrillation, 7,727 heart failure and 2,809 acute myocardial infarction events. At 1 and 5 years, the cumulative risks of all-cause CVD increased from 1.5 in periods of non-use to 9.1 for a daily prednisolone-equivalent dose of 25.0mg, and from 7.6 to 29.9, respectively. We found strong dose-dependent estimates for all immune-mediated diseases hazard ratio HR for 5.0mg daily dose vs. non-use1.74, 95CI 1.64-1.84 range 1.52 for polymyalgia rheumatica and/or giant cell arteritis to 2.82 for systemic lupus erythematosus, all cardiovascular outcomes, regardless of disease activity level.

"Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection","Background/introductionCOVID19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID19 severity.MethodThis study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID19 infection or ICU admission.ResultsOf the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies including 1813 COVID19 patients were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older 62.4 years compared to the non-ICU group 46 years, with a significantly higher proportion of males 67.2 vs. 57.1, p0.04. Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease pOR 3.70, 95 CI 1.83  7.46 and ICU admission pOR 6.55, 95 CI 4.28  10.0. Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups 4.5 and 9.7, respectivel,y COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease pOR 6.42, 95 CI 2.44  16.9 and ICU admission pOR 17.8, 95 CI 6.56  48.2. Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 95 CI 2.64  7.47 and 3.7 95 CI 2.22  5.99 times more likely to have an ICU admission respectivel,y compared to patients without the comorbidity.ConclusionsDyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severit,y COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID19.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1.full.pdf",20200316,"Public and Global Health","Jain","/highwire/citation/73573/bibtext",8,"170320-8","17/03/2020",73573
"US Mortality Due To Congenital Heart Disease Across the Lifespan from 1999-2017 Exposes Persistent Racial/Ethnic Disparities","ABSTRACTBackgroundCongenital heart disease CHD accounts for approximately 40 percent of deaths in United States US children with birth defects. Previous US data from 1999-2006 demonstrated an overall decrease in CHD mortality. The objective of our study was to assess current trends in US mortality related to CHD from infancy to adulthood over the last 19 years and determine differences by sex and race/ethnicity.MethodsWe conducted an analysis of death certificates from 1999-2017 to calculate annual CHD mortality by age at death, race/ethnicit,y and se.x Population estimates used as denominators in mortality rate calculation for infants were based on National Center for Health Statistics live birth data. Mortality rates in individuals 1 year of age utilized US Census Bureau bridged-race estimates as denominators for population estimates. We characterized temporal trends in all-cause mortalit,y mortality resulting directly due to and related to CHD by age, race/ethnicit,y and sex using joinpoint regression.Results There were 47.7 million deaths with 1 in 814 deaths due to CHD n58,599. While all-cause mortality decreased 16.4 across all ages, mortality resulting from CHD declined 39.4 overall. The mean annual decrease in CHD mortality was 2.6, with the largest decrease for those age 65years. The age-adjusted mortality rate decreased from 1.37 to 0.83 per 100,000. Males had higher mortality due to CHD than females throughout the stud,y although both sexes declined at a similar rate 40 overall, with a 3-4 annual decrease between 1999 and 2009, followed by a slower annual decrease of 1.4 through 2017. Mortality resulting from CHD significantly declined among all race/ethnicities studied, although disparities in mortality persisted for non-Hispanic Blacks versus non-Hispanic Whites mean annual decrease 2.3 versus 2.6, respectively age-adjusted mortality rate 1.67 to 1.05 versus 1.35 to 0.80 per 100,000, respectively.Conclusions While overall US mortality due to CHD has decreased over the last 19 years, disparities in mortality persist for males compared to females and for non-Hispanic Blacks compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Determining factors that contribute to these disparities such as access to quality care, timely diagnosis, and maintenance of insurance will be important moving into the next decade.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036525v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036525v1.full.pdf",20200318,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Lopez","/highwire/citation/73769/bibtext",55,"180320-55","18-03-2020",73769
"Elucidating mechanisms of genetic cross-disease associations an integrative approach implicates protein C as a causal pathway in arterial and venous diseases","Genome-wide association studies have identified many individual genetic loci associated with multiple complex traits and common diseases. There are, however, few examples where the molecular basis of such pleiotropy has been elucidated. To address this challenge, we describe an integrative approach, focusing on the p.Ser219Gly rs867186 AG variant in the PROCR gene encoding the endothelial protein C receptor, EPCR, which has been associated with lower coronary artery disease CAD risk but higher venous thromboembolism VTE risk. In a phenome scan of 12 cardiometabolic diseases and 24 molecular factors, we found that PROCR-219Gly associated with higher plasma levels of zymogenic and activated protein C as well as coagulation factor VII. Using statistical colocalization and Mendelian randomization analyses, we uncovered shared genetic etiology across activated protein C, factor VII, CAD and VTE, identifying p.S219G as the likely causal variant at the locus. In a recall-by-genotype study of 52 healthy volunteers stratified by p.S219G, we detected 2.5-fold higher soluble EPCR levels and 1.2-fold higher protein C levels in plasma per effect allele, suggesting the allele induces EPCR shedding from the membrane of endothelial cells. Finall,y in cell adhesion assays, we found that increasing concentrations of activated protein C, but not soluble EPCR, reduced leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, a marker for vascular inflammation. These results support a role for protein C as a causal factor in arterial and venous diseases, suggesting that PROCR-219Gly protects against CAD through anti-inflammatory mechanisms while it promotes VTE risk through pro-thrombotic mechanisms. Overall, our study illustrates a multi-modal approach that can help reveal molecular underpinnings of cross-disease associations.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036822v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036822v1.full.pdf",20200320,"Genetic and Genomic Medicine","Stacey","/highwire/citation/73883/bibtext",38,"250320-38","25-03-2020",73883
"Development and Evaluation of an Android-based Platform for Early MCI Detection in an Elderly Population","Background Mild cognitive impairment MCI is an intermediate stage of cognitive decline fitting in-between normal cognition and dementia. With the growing aging population, this study aimed to develop and psychometrically validate an android-based application for early MCI detection in elderly subjects.Method This study was conducted in two phases, including 1- Initial design and prototyping of the application named M-Check, 2- psychometric evaluation. After the design and development of the M-Check app, it was evaluated by experts and elderly subjects. Face validity was determined by two checklists provided to the expert panel and the elderly subjects. Convergent validity of the M-Check app was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment MoCA battery through Pearson correlation. Test-retest and internal consistency and reliability were evaluated using Intra-Class Correlation ICC and Kuder-Richardson coefficients, respectively. In addition, the usability was assessed by a System Usability Scale SUS questionnaire. SPSS 16.0 was employed to analyze the data.Result The apps usability assessment by elderlies and experts scored 77.11 and 82.5, respectively. Also, the correlation showed that the M-Check app was negatively correlated with the MoCA test r  -0.71, p 0.005, and the ICC was more than 0.7. Moreover, the Richardsons Coder coefficient was 0.82, corresponding to an acceptable reliability. Conclusion In this stud,y we validated the M-Check app for the detection of MCI based on the growing need for cognitive assessment tools that can identify early decline. Such screeners are expected to take much shorter time than typical neuropsychological batteries do. Additional work are yet to be underway to ensure that M-Check is ready to launch and used without the presence of a trained person.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037028v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037028v1.full.pdf",20200320,"Health Informatics","Roozrokh Arshadi Montazer","/highwire/citation/73870/bibtext",31,"250320-31","25-03-2020",73870

"Differential transcript usage unravels transcriptional alterations in Alzheimers disease human brains","Alzheimers disease AD is the leading cause of dementia in aging individuals. However pathophysiological processes involved in the brain are still poorly understood. Among numerous strategies, a comprehensive overview of gene expression alterations in the diseased brain has been proposed to help for a better knowledge of the disease processes. In this work, we compared the differential expression of genes in different regions temporal and frontal lobes of the brain of healthy and AD adult subjects using data from three large studies MAYO Clinic Mount Sinai Brain Bank MSBB and ROSMAP. We show that gene expression is dramatically altered in the temporal lobe TL, but not in the frontal lobe FL, suggesting regional specificities in transcriptional alterations. Moreover, we show that a large set of genes undetected in the classical differential expression DEG analysis show alterations in the transcript usage ratio in AD, i.e. differential isoform fractions. Interestingl,y the number of genes with differential transcript usage gDTUs is highest at advanced Braak stages and correlates with altered expression of genes associated with the splicing machinery. Using single-cell RNA sequencing scRNAseq data, we further assigned DEGs and gDTUs to individual cell types of the adult brain and observed similar signatures per cell type as to other two scRNAseq studies in AD. Lastl,y we show that 52 out of 116 genes located in the loci associated with AD risk and expressed in the adult human brain present DEG and/or gDTUs in the TL, whereas only 13 are altered in the FL of AD patients. Among those altered genes, we detect an increased expression of APP isoforms containing the Kunitz protease inhibitor KPI domain, which is associated with plaque deposition. Altogether, our work proposes a novel integrative strategy to analyze transcriptional data in AD based on both gene/transcript expression and cell-type specificities.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038703v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038703v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Neurology","Coelho","/highwire/citation/74204/bibtext",199,"250320-199","25-03-2020",74204
"Myocardial injury is associated with in-hospital mortality of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in Wuhan, China A single center retrospective cohort study","Background Since December 2019, a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread rapidly from China to other countries. In-hospital mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients are scarce.Objectives To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.Methods Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th Februar,y 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.Results A total of 110 patients with confirmed n80 or suspected n30 COVID-19 were screened and 48 patients female 31.3, mean age 70.5813.38 year old among them with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I hs-cTnI test within 48 hours after admission were included, of whom 17 17/48, 35.4 died in hospital while 31 31/48, 64.6 were discharged or transferred to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was levated in 13 13/48, 27.1 patents. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation SpO2 on admission HR 0.704, 95 CI 0.546-0.909, per 1 decrease, p0.007, elevated hs-cTnI HR 10.902, 95 1.279-92.927, p0.029 and elevated d-dimer HR 1.103, 95CI 1.034-1.176, per 1mg/L increase, p0.003 on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.Conclusions Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040121v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040121v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Zhang","/highwire/citation/74208/bibtext",203,"250320-203","25-03-2020",74208
"Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults","RAPID COMMUNICATION 22 March 2020Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults  Background The medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom to date at least have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background pre-COVID-19 mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England HDR UK - CALIBER, we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines 16 March 2020 in 3,862,012 individuals aged 30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available https//caliberresearch.org/portal, for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk RR of the impact of the emergency compared to background mortality of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. Findings 20.0 of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which  13.7 were age70 years and 6.3 aged 70 years with 1 underlying condition cardiovascular disease 2.3, diabetes 2.2, steroid therapy 1.9, severe obesity 0.9, chronic kidney disease 0.6 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD 0.5. Multimorbidity co-occurrence of 2 conditions in an individual was common 10.1.  The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions 5.9 in age70 years, 8.6 for COPD and 13.1 in those with 3 or more conditions. In a suppression scenario at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001 of the UK population, there would be minimal excess deaths 3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. At SARS CoV2 rates of 10 of the UK population mitigation the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as 13791, 34479 and 68957 at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. At SARS CoV2 rates of  80 in the UK population do-nothing, the model estimates the number of excess deaths as  110332, 275,830 and 551,659 at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. Interpretation We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages.  If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20 similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess, then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 suppression, 13791 when 1 in 10 mitigation and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected do nothing scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040287v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040287v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Public and Global Health","Banerjee","/highwire/citation/74205/bibtext",200,"250320-200","25-03-2020",74205
"Hypertension and Diabetes Delay the Viral Clearance in COVID-19 Patients","Objectives Comorbidities have significant indications for the disease outcome of COVID-19, however which underlying diseases that contribute the most to aggravate the conditions of COVID-19 patients is still largely unknown. SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is a golden standard for defining the recovery of COVID-19 infections. To dissect the underlying diseases that could impact on viral clearance, we enrolled 106 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan Universit,y Wuhan, China between Jan 5 and Feb 25, 2020.Methodology We comprehensively analyzed demographic, clinical and laboratory data, as well as patient treatment records. Survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modelling were employed to identify factors influencing the viral clearance negatively. Results We found that increasing age, male gender, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ACE2 associated factors including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases adversely affected the viral clearance. Furthermore, analysis by a random forest survival model pointed out hypertension, cortisone treatment, gender, and age as the four most important variables. Conclusions We conclude that patients at old age, males, and/or having diseases associated with high expression of ACE2 will have worse prognosis during a COVID-19 infections.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040774v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040774v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","Chen","/highwire/citation/74182/bibtext",193,"250320-193","25-03-2020",74182
"Prediction of coronary disease incidence in the general population by circulating RNYYRNAderived small RNA","During the development of atherosclerotic lesion, s-RNYs small RNAs of about 24/34 nucleotides are derived by the processing of long Ro-associated non-coding RNAs RNYs in macrophages. The levels of serum s-RNYs have been found significantly upregulated in patients with coronary heart disease CHD compared to age-matched healthy individuals. The present study aimed to examine the predictive value of serum s-RNYs for CHD events in the general population. Within the frame of nested-case-control stud,y the GENES stud,y we measured the absolute expression of a RNY-derived small RNA, the s-RNY1-5p, in the serum of healthy individuals who encountered a CHD event within 12 years of follow-up n  31 Cases and compared them to individuals who remained event-free Controls n  30. The expression of s-RNY1-5p in serum was significantly upregulated in Cases compared to Controls p  0.027. The proportion of CHD event-free was significantly higher among individuals with serum s-RNY15p below the median value 631 molecule / mL. In a multivariate model adjusted for age, smoking and treatment for hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, the risk of CHD events increased more than 4-fold in individuals with serum s-RNY1-5p above the median value HR, 4.36 95CI, 1.22-15.60. Significant association with CHD events was also observed when considering s-RNY1-5p as a continuous variable p  0.022. Serum s-RNY1-5p is an independent predictor of CHD in healthy individuals and could be considered as a biomarker in primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042812v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042812v1.full.pdf",20200326,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Costa","/highwire/citation/74298/bibtext",31,"270320-31","27-03-2020",74298
"COVID-19 clinical characteristics, and sex-specific risk of mortality Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Objectives The rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. It was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China and has spread globally resulting in substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified the different aspects of this disease. Up to this date, no comprehensive systematic review for the clinical, laborator,y epidemiologic and mortality findings has been published. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis for a better understanding of COVID-19.Methods We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA version 14, IC Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA. The pooled frequency with 95 confidence intervals CI was assessed using random effect model. Publication bias was assessed and p 0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias.Results Out of 1102 studies, 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 4789 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever 83.0, CI 77.5 to 87.6, cough 65.2, CI 58.6 to 71.2 and myalgia/fatigue 34.7, CI 26.0 to 44.4 were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension 18.5 , CI 12.7 to 24.4 and Cardiovascular disease 14.9 , CI 6.0 to 23.8. Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein CRP 72.0 CI 54.3 to 84.6 and lymphopenia 50.1, CI 38.0 to 62.4 were the most common findings. Bilateral ground-glass opacities 66.0, CI 51.1 to 78.0 was the most common CT-Scan presentation. Pooled mortality rate was 6.6, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females OR 3.4 95 CI 1.2 to 9.1, P0.01. Conclusion COVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory findings.  Mortality associated with COVID19 was higher than that reported in studies in China with Males having a 3-fold higher risk of mortality in COVID19 compared to females.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042903v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042903v1.full.pdf",20200326,"Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","Nasiri","/highwire/citation/74304/bibtext",32,"270320-32","27-03-2020",74304
