"Automated interpretation of the coronary angioscopy with deep convolutional neural networks","Background Coronary angioscopy CAS is a useful modality to assess atherosclerotic changes, but interpretation of the images requires expert knowledge. Deep convolutional neural networks DCNN can be used for diagnostic prediction and image synthesis.Methods 107 images from 47 patients, who underwent coronary angioscopy in our hospital between 2014 and 2017, and 864 images, selected from 142 MEDLINE-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2019, were analyzed. First, we developed a prediction model for the angioscopic findings. Next, we made a generative adversarial networks GAN model to simulate the CAS images. Finall,y we tried to control the output images according to the angioscopic findings with conditional GAN architecture.Results For both yellow color YC grade and neointimal coverage NC grade, we could observe strong correlations between the true grades and the predicted values YC grade, average r value  0.80  0.02, p-value 0.001 NC grade, average r value  0.73  0.02, p  0.001. The binary classification model for the red thrombus yielded 0.71  0.03 F1- score and the area under the ROC curve AUC was 0.91  0.02. The standard GAN model could generate realistic CAS images average Inception score  3.57  0.06. GAN-based data augmentation improved the performance of the prediction models. In the conditional GAN model, there were significant correlations between given values and experts diagnosis in YC grade but not in NC grade.Conclusion DCNN is useful in both predictive and generative modeling that can help develop the diagnostic support system for CAS.","/content/10.1101/19001693v3","/content/10.1101/19001693v3.full.pdf",20200108,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Miyoshi","/highwire/citation/71060/bibtext",2,"090120-2","09/01/2020",71060
"Mechanisms of Arrhythmogenicity in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Insight from Noninvasive Electrocardiographic Imaging","Background Mechanisms of arrhythmogenicity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy HCM are not well understood. We hypothesized that HCM is characterized by the specific electrophysiological substrate as compared to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy ICM, or healthy individuals.Methods We conducted a prospective case-control study. The study enrolled HCM patients at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmia VT n10 age 619 y left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF 609, and three comparison groups healthy individuals n10 age 286 y LVEF70, ICM patients with LV hypertrophy LVH and known VT n10 age 649 y LVEF 3115, and ICM patients with LVH and no known VT n10 age 70  7y LVEF 4616. All participants underwent 12-lead ECG, cardiac CT or MRI, and 128-electrode body surface mapping BioSemi ActiveTwo, Netherlands. Non-invasive voltage and activation maps were reconstructed using the open-source SCIRun University of Utah inverse problem-solving environment.Results In the epicardial basal anterior segment, HCM patients had the greatest ventricular activation dispersion 16.45.5 vs. 13.12.7 ICM with VT vs. 13.84.3 ICM no VT vs. 8.12.4 ms Healthy P0.0007, the largest unipolar voltage 1094211 vs. 934189 ICM with VT vs. 898358 ICM no VT vs. 84290 V Healthy P0.023, and the greatest voltage dispersion medianinterquartile range 215161-281 vs. 189143-208 ICM with VT vs. 158109-236 ICM no VT vs. 110106-168V Healthy P0.041.

"Violin plot data A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity classified using laboratory measured valve motion","ObjectivesWe hypothesize that prosthetic valve thrombogenic potential may be inferred by valve regional flow velocity. This metric was used to compare two clinical valves and two experimental prototypes. Methods Four our clinical and experimental prototype valve models were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. Regurgitant flow velocity was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate / projected dynamic valve area. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, thrombogenic potential for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as regurgitant flow velocities relative to the control mechanical valve regurgitant flow velocity of -126 m/s. Analysis of the flow velocity data made use of Vioplot R and VISIO software packages to provide split violin plots that represent probability of recurrence of data. Results Thrombogenic potential was made dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and 1.0. Negative thrombogenic potentials arise when transient rebound of valve occluder is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive thrombogenic potentials occur during decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest thrombogenic potential transient of 0.15. A mock-transcatheter aortic valve replacement incorporating by design a trivial paravalvular leak 1.35 ml/s demonstrated a high transient thrombogenic potential of 0.95. Conclusions Our data reveals distinct thrombogenic potential profile differences between valve models. If our study methods are verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to produce advanced devices with significantly reduced thrombogenic potential.","/content/10.1101/19009407v7","/content/10.1101/19009407v7.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","SCOTTEN","/highwire/citation/72630/bibtext",56,"270220-56","27/02/2020",72630
"Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation for refractory scar-related ventricular tachycardia","BackgroundStereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiotherapy that is performed in a single session and focuses high-dose ionizing radiation beams from a collimated radiation source to a small, localized area of the body. Recentl,y stereotactic radiosurgery has been applied to arrhythmias stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation - STAR, with promising results reported in patients with refractor,y scar-related ventricular tachycardia VT, a cohort with known high morbidity and mortality.ObjectiveHerein, we describe our experience with the use of CyberKnife, a frameless image-guided linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery system, in conjunction with CardioPlan, a cardiac specific radiotherapy planning software, to treat patients with scar-related VT, detailing its early and mid- to long-term results.MethodsThis is a pilot, prospective study of patients undergoing STAR for refractory VT. The anatomical target for radioablation was defined based on the clinical VT morpholog,y electroanatomical mapping, and study-specific pre-procedural imaging with cardiac computed tomography. The target volume delineated with the aid of CardioPlan was treated with a prescription radiation dose of 25 Gy delivered in a single fraction by CyberKnife in an outpatient setting. Ventricular arrhythmias and radiation-related adverse events were monitored at follow-up to determine STAR efficacy and safety.ResultFive patients 100  male, 63  12 years old, 80  ischemic cardiomyopath,y left ventricular ejection fraction 34  15  with refractory VT underwent STAR between January and June 2018. Radioablation was delivered in 82  11 minutes without acute complications. During a mean follow-up of 12  2 months, all patients experienced clinically significant mid- to late-term ventricular arrhythmia recurrence two patients died of complications associated with their advanced heart failure. There were no clinical or imaging evidence of radiation necrosis or other radiation-induced complications in the organs at risk surrounding the scar targeted by radioablation.ConclusionDespite good initial results, STAR did not result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in a selected, high-risk population of patients with scar-related VT. The safety profile was confirmed to be favorable, with no radiation-related complications observed during follow-up. Further studies are needed to explain these disappointing results.","/content/10.1101/19012880v2","/content/10.1101/19012880v2.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Gianni","/highwire/citation/72533/bibtext",4,"270220-4","27/02/2020",72533
"A Preoperative Estimate of Central Venous Pressure Is Associated with Early Fontan Failure","Objective Early Fontan Failure EFF is a serious complication following total cavopulmonary connection TCPC, characterised by high central venous pressure CVP, low cardiac output and resistance to medical therapy. This study aimed to estimate post-operative CVP in TCPC patients CVPTCPC using data routinely collected during pre-operative assessment. We sought to determine if this metric correlated with measured post-operative CVP and if it was associated with EFF.Methods In this retrospective stud,y CVPTCPC was estimated in 131 patients undergoing pre-TCPC assessment by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and CVP measurement under general anaesthesia. Post-operative CVP during the first 24hours in ICU was collected from electronic patient records in a subset of patients. EFF was defined as death, transplantation, TCPC takedown or emergency fenestration within the first 30days.ResultsEstimated CVPTCPC correlated significantly with CVPICU r0.26, p0.03, particularly in patients without a fenestration r0.45, p0.01. CVPTCPC was significantly associated with EFF Odds Ratio OR 1.12 1.02-1.24, p0.02. A threshold of CVPTCPC  33mmHg was found to have the highest specificity 90 and sensitivity 67 for identifying EFF area under receiver operating curve, AUC  0.79, OR 18.8 3.1-114, p0.001. This association was stronger in patients with single SVCs.ConclusionsEstimated CVPTCPC is an easily calculated metric combining pre-operative pressure and flow data. Higher CVPTCPC is associated with an increased risk of EFF and is correlated with directly measured post-TCPC pressure. Identification of patients at risk of EFF has the potential to guide risk mitigation strategies.","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016048v1","/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016048v1.full.pdf",20200102,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Quail","/highwire/citation/70954/bibtext",13,"030120-13","03/01/2020",70954
"Cardiac Microstructural Abnormalities Identify Women at Risk of Incident Heart Failure","Background Incidence of congestive heart failure is difficult to predict by standard methods. We have developed a method called the signal intensity coefficient that uses echocardiographic texture analysis to quantify microstructural changes which may occur in at-risk patients prior to development of a clinical heart failure syndrome.Methods Participants from the Framingham Offspring Cohort study who attended the 8th visit and received screening echocardiography were included. Participants were followed for a mean of 7.4 years for incident congestive heart failure. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the hazard ratio of signal intensity coefficient in the top quartile of values versus other quartiles in the total and sex-stratified population.Results 2511 participants with interpretable echocardiography and no history of congestive heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction were included in this study. The top quartile signal intensity coefficient had a hazard ratio of 1.83 p0.0048 for incident heart failure. When additional clinical risk factors were added to the model, this became non-significant. Within women, an elevated hazard ratio was significant in multiple models including age and hypertensive medication use. Models were not significant in men.Conclusions Elevated signal intensity coefficient is associated with an increased risk of incident congestive heart failure. This trend remains significant in women after inclusion of age and hypertensive medication use. The signal intensity coefficient may be able to identify patients at risk of developing congestive heart failure using echocardiographic texture analysis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016477v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016477v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Kwan","/highwire/citation/71080/bibtext",24,"110120-24","11/01/2020",71080
"The modified arterial reservoir an update with consideration of asymptotic pressure P and zero-flow pressure Pzf","This article describes the modified arterial reservoir in detail. The modified arterial reservoir makes explicit the wave nature of both reservoir Pres and excess pressure Pxs.  The mathematical derivation and methods for estimating Pres in the absence of flow velocity data are described. There is also discussion of zero-flow pressure Pzf, the pressure at which flow through the circulation ceases its relationship to asymptotic pressure P estimated by the reservoir model and the physiological interpretation of Pzf . A systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that Pzf differs from mean circulatory filling pressure.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018440v2","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018440v2.full.pdf",20200311,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Hughes","/highwire/citation/73399/bibtext",4,"120320-4","12/03/2020",73399
"Feasibility of estimation of aortic wave intensity using non-invasive pressure recordings in the absence of flow velocity in man.","Background Wave intensity analysis provides valuable information on ventriculo-arterial function, hemodynamics and energy transfer in the arterial circulation. Widespread use of wave intensity analysis is limited by the need for concurrent measurement of pressure and flow waveforms. We describe a method that can estimate wave intensity patterns using only non-invasive pressure waveforms, and its reproducibility.Methods Radial artery pressure and left ventricular outflow tract LVOT flow velocity waveforms were recorded in 12 participants in the Southall and Brent Revisited SABRE study. Pressure waveforms were analysed using custom-written software to derive the excess pressure Pxs which was compared with the LVOT flow velocity waveform, and used to calculate wave intensity. In a separate stud,y repeat measures of wave intensity and other wave and reservoir parameters were performed on 34 individuals who attended 2 clinic visits at an interval of approximately 1 month to assess reproducibility and reliability of the method.Results Pxs waveforms were similar in shape to aortic flow velocity waveforms and the time of peak Pxs and maximum aortic velocity agreed closely mean difference  0.00 limits of agreement -0.02, 0.02s. Wave intensity patterns when scaled to peak LVOT velocity gave credible estimates of wave intensity similar to values reported previously in the literature. The method showed fair to good reproducibility for most parameters.Conclusions The Pxs is a surrogate of LVOT flow velocity allowing estimation of aortic wave intensity with acceptable reproducibility. This enables widespread application of wave intensity analysis to large studies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018457v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018457v1.full.pdf",20200124,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Hughes","/highwire/citation/71376/bibtext",5,"250120-5","25/01/2020",71376
"A Pilot Study of an Esophageal Cooling Device During Radiofrequency Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation","Background Esophageal thermal injury is a risk of ablation of the posterior left atrium despite various devices utilized to date.  Objective Evaluate the potential of a commercially-available esophageal cooling device to provide esophageal protection during left atrial catheter ablation. Methods In this pilot stud,y we randomized 6 patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.  Three patients received standard of care for our site use of a single-sensor temperature probe, with adjunct iced-water instillation for any temperature increases 1C.  Three patients received standard ablation after placement of the esophageal cooling device using a circulating water temperature of 4C.  All patients underwent transesophageal echocardiogram TEE and esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD on the day prior to ablation followed by EGD on the day after. Results In the 3 control patients, one had no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, one had diffuse sloughing of the esophageal mucosa and multiple ulcerations, and one had a superficial ulcer with large clot.  Both patients with lesions were classified as Zargar 2a.  In the 3 patients treated with the cooling device, one had no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, one had esophageal erythema Zargar 1, and one had a solitary Zargar 2a lesion.  At 3-month follow-up, 1 patient in each group had recurrence of atrial fibrillation.Conclusions The extent of esophageal injury was less severe with a commercially available esophageal cooling device than with reactive instillation of ice-cold water.

"Evaluation of Myocardial Perfusion and Immune Cell Response in Cardiac Allograft Dysfunction of Heart-Transplant Patients","Background We investigated the myocardial perfusion differences and changes in immune cell response in heart-transplant patients with nonspecific graft dysfunction NGD compared to cardiac allograft vasculopathy CAV patients and normal heart-transplant patients.Methods and Results We prospectively studied 17 heart-transplant patients 59.8/-14.1 years, 78 male from January to June 2016. Regadenoson stress cardiac MRI was performed in the patients and peripheral blood obtained contemporaneously to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs. Stress myocardial perfusion showed significantly decreased myocardial perfusion using maximum upslope method in NGD and CAV patients compared to normal heart-transplant patients. Myocardial scar by late gadolinium enhancement also was significantly increased in nonspecific graft dysfunction patients compared to normal. Evaluation of PBMCs by flow cytometry showed a trend towards increased activated HLA-DR T cells in NGD patients compared to normal. Clinical outcomes for cardiac hospitalization, allograft loss/retransplant, death were assessed at 3 years.Conclusions NGD shows decreased stress myocardial perfusion by cardiac MRI and a trend towards increased activated T cells in PBMCs, suggestive of an immune-mediated cause for allograft dysfunction.Key Words cardiac allograft dysfunction stress myocardial perfusion cardiac allograft vasculopathy","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20018168v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20018168v1.full.pdf",20200130,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Kim","/highwire/citation/71633/bibtext",3,"310120-3","31/01/2020",71633
"Developing an Individualized Clinical Prediction Rules of Antihypertensive Drugs A Study Protocol Based on Real-world Practice","Background Hypertension is one of the most urgent public health challenges, and drug therapy is the primary method to control blood pressure for patients. However, blood pressure control rate is still poor with antihypertensive drugs use. Although Clinical Prediction Rules CPR is useful to help clinicians make more appropriate decisions at the point of medication, the evidence is still limited in china. The objective of this study is to develop an CPR of antihypertensive drugs in individualized application of patients based on real-world practice.Methods  A two-way cohort study has been conducted in one Chinas large tertiary hospital using clinical information on patient characteristics, drug use and clinical outcome. Data extraction is through ICD-10 disease codes of hypertension from Electronic Medical Record System. Eligible patients admitted from September 2016 to August 2018 who have received at least one antihypertensive drug therapy is included. Patients were grouped into several exposure groups according to medications. COX regression model and clinical specialty survey is applied to identify Influencing Factors IF in different study groups, and the discriminant model was used to construct a CPR according IF. The accuracy of the CPR is analyzed by sensitivit,y specificit,y Youdens index and Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC curve.Discussion Result is expected to provide valuable CPR for physicians and policymakers with respect to treating hypertension according characteristic of individual patients.

"Improving Esophageal Protection during AF ablation the IMPACT study.","Background Thermal injury to the esophagus is a known complication of ablation for atrial fibrillation AF and accounts for most procedure-related mortality. Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen by infusing cold liquid can reduce thermal injury to a limited extent. Objective To investigate the ability of a powerful temperature control device to protect the esophagus from ablation-related thermal injury.Methods A single-center, prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial was used to investigate the ability of the ensoETM device to protect the esophagus from thermal injury. This method was compared in a 11 randomization to a control group of standard practice utilizing a single-point temperature probe. In the study group, the device was used to keep the luminal temperature at 4 degrees during radiofrequency RF ablation for AF. Endoscopic examination was performed at 7 days post-ablation and esophageal injury was scored. The patient and the endoscopist were blinded to the randomization.Results We recruited 188 patients, of whom 120 underwent endoscopy. Thermal injury to the mucosa was significantly more common in the control group than in those receiving esophageal protection 12/60 versus 2/60 P0.008, with a trend toward reduction in gastroparesis 6/60 Vs 2/60, p0.27. There was no difference between groups in RF duration, force, power and combined ablation index P value range 0.2-0.9.

"Quantification of positive family history as a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease","Objective There is very little research regarding quantification of family history as a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease. This is especially so in the South Asian population, which tends to suffer from ischaemic heart disease at a much younger age, even after environmental and dietary factors are accounted for. This indicates a likely genetic basis. The aim of this study was to quantify family history as a risk factor.Methods It is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Patients with family history and hypertension as the only cardiac risk factors were recruited in the study along with control subjects. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was used for the detection of myocardial ischemia.Results 114 patients had hypertension and family history as the only risk factors. 64 of these patients had myocardial ischemia. 102 control patients were also recruited, of whom only 26 suffered from myocardial ischemia. The odds-ratio was thus calculated to be 3.69 95 CI 1.54-9.28, p0.001.Conclusions These findings suggest a strong genetic basis for ischemic heart disease in the South Asian population.

We hypothesised that if PMI and ACS share pathophysiological mechanisms, common microRNA signatures should be evident. Methods Nested case-control study of samples obtained before and after non-cardiac surgery from patients enrolled in two prospective observational studies of PMI postoperative troponin I/T99th centile. In cohort one, serum microRNAs were compared between patients with/without PMI, matched for age, gender and comorbidity. Real-time polymerase chain reaction quantified relative microRNA expression cycle quantification threshold 37 before and after surgery for microRNA signatures associated with ACS, blinded to PMI. In cohort two, we analysed EdgeR microRNA from plasma extracellular vesicles using next-generation sequencing Illumina HiSeq500. microRNA-messenger RNA-function pathway analysis was performed DIANA miRPath v3.0/TopGO.Results MicroRNA were detectable in all 59 patients median age67yrs 61-75 42 male, who had similar clinical characteristics independent of developing PMI.

"Polygenic Risk Score Modifies Risk of Coronary Artery Disease Conferred by Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol","An individuals lifetime risk of Coronary Artery Disease CAD is determined by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Whilst adherence to a healthy lifestyle can help individuals with high genetic risk reduce their lifetime risk of CAD, the extent to which blood lipid levels affect CAD risk in individuals with varying genetic risk remains unknown. To explore how genetics, blood lipids and CAD risk interact, we derived a novel genome-wide polygenic risk score PRS for CAD. We then applied the PRS to individuals from the UK Biobank and divided them into Low PRS bottom 10 percentiles of PRS distribution, Intermediate PRS PRS in the 10th-90th percentiles, and High PRS top 10 percentiles, and further stratified individuals by blood lipid levels.We found that the elevated CAD risk conferred by high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C was modified by the interaction with PRS P-value interaction 0.005. Individuals with High PRS and whose LDL-C was Borderline between 130 and 160 mg/dL had higher CAD relative risk HR 3.10 95 CI, 2.55-3.76 than those at Intermediate PRS whose LDL-C were Very High 190 mg/dL HR 2.77 95 CI, 2.33-3.28. Furthermore, individuals with High PRS but whose lipid levels were below the following thresholds did not have a significantly increased risk for incident CAD LDL-C 130 mg/dL, total Cholesterol TC 200 mg/dL, LDL-CHDL 2.0 and TCHDL 3.0. In addition, individuals with Low PRS and Very High LDL-C 190 mg/dl did not have increased CAD risk, which was comparable to individuals with Intermediate PRS and Optimal LDL-C 130 mg/dL.Our results have important implications for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease. Currentl,y healthy individuals with Borderline LDL-C 130-159 mg/dL are not considered to be at high risk of CAD. Here we demonstrate that the combination of Borderline LDL-C and High PRS results in CAD relative risk which is greater than individuals without high polygenic risk, but whose LDL-C levels are high enough for statins to be recommended 190 mg/dL. This analysis therefore demonstrates that PRS can identify a proportion of the population who are at high-risk of CAD but who are invisible to current approaches for assessing CAD risk. Moreover, of perhaps greater significance is the evidence that individuals who have a combination of High PRS and Optimal blood lipid levels do not have greater risk of CAD than individuals without high polygenic risk and the same Optimal blood lipid levels. Our results suggest that high polygenic risk for CAD could be overcome by controlling blood lipid levels. We propose that incorporating PRS into CAD risk assessment early in life could allow individuals at high polygenic risk to benefit from tailored blood lipid guidelines and avoid lifetime exposure to potentially damaging PRS-dependent LDL-C levels.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029454v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029454v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Bolli","/highwire/citation/73031/bibtext",41,"060320-41","06/03/2020",73031
"High Density Lipoprotein pathway as a therapeutic target for coronary heart disease individual participant meta-analysis in 28,597 individuals with 4197 coronary events","Importance Cholesterol content in high-density lipoprotein particles HDL-C is associated inversely with coronary heart disease CHD, but findings from Mendelian randomization studies and randomized trials of HDL-C raising drugs have questioned whether this link is causal.  However, these analyses do not exclude a causal role for specific HDL sub-fractions of different densit,y mobilit,y size and composition. Objective To determine whether sub-components of the HDL pathway exhibit differing relationships with CHD risk.Design In seven longitudinal studies, we used factor analysis to reduce 21 measures of HDL particle size and lipid content to a smaller number of factors representing different components of the HDL pathway. We constructed factor scores and modelled their associations on CHD risk in adjusted Cox regression analyses. We pooled results using random-effects meta-analysis.Setting Seven population-, individual-, occupational- or community-based longitudinal studies in the UK and Finland.Participants 28,597 participants 49 female, mean age 59.6 years contributed to the analysis.Exposures Sub-components of the HDL pathwa,y characterized by 21 measures of HDL size and lipid content based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Main Outcomes Incident fatal or non-fatal CHD.Results We identified 4 HDL components with highly replicable across studies 3 were indices of particle size/composition extra-large XL, large L and medium/small MS, and the other an index of triglycerides TG carried in HDL of all sizes. After up to 17 years of follow-up, 4179 incident CHD cases occurred. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicit,y smoking, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes and LDL-C, higher levels of the XL and MS factors were linked to a reduced risk of CHD hazard ratio per 1 standard deviation SD increase 0.88 95 CI 0.85, 0.92 and 0.91 0.87, 0.94. In contrast, a SD increase in the level of the TG factor was associated with increased risk of CHD 1.10 1.07, 1.14.Conclusions and Relevance We found qualitative differences between sub-components of the HDL pathway and the risk of developing CHD.

"Prediction of Venous Thromboembolism Based on Clinical and Genetic Factors","BACKGROUND Both clinical and genetic factors drive the risk of venous thromboembolism. However, whether clinically recorded risk factors and genetic variants can be combined into a clinically applicable predictive score remains unknown. METHODS Using Cox proportional-hazard models, we analyzed the association of risk factors with the likelihood of venous thromboembolism in U.K. Biobank, a large prospective cohort. We created a novel ten point clinical score using seven established clinical risk factors for venous thromboembolism. We also generated a polygenic risk score of 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms to quantify genetic risk. The genetic score was categorized into high risk top two deciles of scores, intermediate risk deciles three to eight, and low risk lowest two deciles. The discrete clinical score led to the following approximate decile categorizations high risk 5 to 10 points, intermediate risk 3 to 4 points, and low risk 0 to 2 points. RESULTS Amongst the 502,536 participants in the U.K. Biobank, there were 4,843 events of venous thromboembolism. Analyses of established clinical risk factors and the most commonly used medications revealed that participants were at decreased risk of venous thromboembolism if they had ever used oral contraceptive pills hazard ratio, 0.88 95 confidence interval CI, 0.79 to 0.99 or if they currently used bendroflumethiazide hazard ratio, 0.84 95 CI, 0.74 to 0.95, cod liver oil capsules hazard ratio, 0.87 95 CI, 0.77 to 0.99, or atenolol hazard ratio, 0.79 95 CI, 0.68 to 0.91. Participants were at significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism if they were at high clinical risk hazard ratio, 5.98 95 CI, 5.43 to 6.59 or high genetic risk hazard ratio, 2.28 95 CI, 2.07 to 2.51 relative to participants at low clinical or genetic risk, respectively. Combining clinical risk factors with genetic risk factors produced a model that better predicted risk of venous thromboembolism than either model alone P0.001.  Participants at high clinical and genetic risk in the combined score had over an eightfold increased risk of venous thromboembolism relative to participants at low risk hazard ratio, 8.27 95 CI 7.59 to 9.00.CONCLUSIONS  By assessing venous thromboembolic events in over 500,000 participants, we identified several known and novel associations between risk factors and venous thromboembolism. Participants in the high risk group of a combined score, consisting of clinical and genetic factors, were over eight times more likely to experience venous thromboembolism than participants in the low risk group.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031054v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031054v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Kolin","/highwire/citation/73082/bibtext",58,"060320-58","06/03/2020",73082
"US Mortality Due To Congenital Heart Disease Across the Lifespan from 1999-2017 Exposes Persistent Racial/Ethnic Disparities","ABSTRACTBackgroundCongenital heart disease CHD accounts for approximately 40 percent of deaths in United States US children with birth defects. Previous US data from 1999-2006 demonstrated an overall decrease in CHD mortality. The objective of our study was to assess current trends in US mortality related to CHD from infancy to adulthood over the last 19 years and determine differences by sex and race/ethnicity.MethodsWe conducted an analysis of death certificates from 1999-2017 to calculate annual CHD mortality by age at death, race/ethnicit,y and se.x Population estimates used as denominators in mortality rate calculation for infants were based on National Center for Health Statistics live birth data. Mortality rates in individuals 1 year of age utilized US Census Bureau bridged-race estimates as denominators for population estimates. We characterized temporal trends in all-cause mortalit,y mortality resulting directly due to and related to CHD by age, race/ethnicit,y and sex using joinpoint regression.Results There were 47.7 million deaths with 1 in 814 deaths due to CHD n58,599. While all-cause mortality decreased 16.4 across all ages, mortality resulting from CHD declined 39.4 overall. The mean annual decrease in CHD mortality was 2.6, with the largest decrease for those age 65years. The age-adjusted mortality rate decreased from 1.37 to 0.83 per 100,000. Males had higher mortality due to CHD than females throughout the stud,y although both sexes declined at a similar rate 40 overall, with a 3-4 annual decrease between 1999 and 2009, followed by a slower annual decrease of 1.4 through 2017. Mortality resulting from CHD significantly declined among all race/ethnicities studied, although disparities in mortality persisted for non-Hispanic Blacks versus non-Hispanic Whites mean annual decrease 2.3 versus 2.6, respectively age-adjusted mortality rate 1.67 to 1.05 versus 1.35 to 0.80 per 100,000, respectively.Conclusions While overall US mortality due to CHD has decreased over the last 19 years, disparities in mortality persist for males compared to females and for non-Hispanic Blacks compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Determining factors that contribute to these disparities such as access to quality care, timely diagnosis, and maintenance of insurance will be important moving into the next decade.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036525v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036525v1.full.pdf",20200318,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Lopez","/highwire/citation/73769/bibtext",55,"180320-55","18-03-2020",73769
"Myocardial injury is associated with in-hospital mortality of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in Wuhan, China A single center retrospective cohort study","Background Since December 2019, a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread rapidly from China to other countries. In-hospital mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients are scarce.Objectives To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.Methods Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th Februar,y 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.Results A total of 110 patients with confirmed n80 or suspected n30 COVID-19 were screened and 48 patients female 31.3, mean age 70.5813.38 year old among them with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I hs-cTnI test within 48 hours after admission were included, of whom 17 17/48, 35.4 died in hospital while 31 31/48, 64.6 were discharged or transferred to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was levated in 13 13/48, 27.1 patents. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation SpO2 on admission HR 0.704, 95 CI 0.546-0.909, per 1 decrease, p0.007, elevated hs-cTnI HR 10.902, 95 1.279-92.927, p0.029 and elevated d-dimer HR 1.103, 95CI 1.034-1.176, per 1mg/L increase, p0.003 on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.Conclusions Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040121v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040121v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Zhang","/highwire/citation/74208/bibtext",203,"250320-203","25-03-2020",74208
"Automated interpretation of the coronary angioscopy with deep convolutional neural networks","Background Coronary angioscopy CAS is a useful modality to assess atherosclerotic changes, but interpretation of the images requires expert knowledge. Deep convolutional neural networks DCNN can be used for diagnostic prediction and image synthesis.Methods 107 images from 47 patients, who underwent coronary angioscopy in our hospital between 2014 and 2017, and 864 images, selected from 142 MEDLINE-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2019, were analyzed. First, we developed a prediction model for the angioscopic findings. Next, we made a generative adversarial networks GAN model to simulate the CAS images. Finall,y we tried to control the output images according to the angioscopic findings with conditional GAN architecture.Results For both yellow color YC grade and neointimal coverage NC grade, we could observe strong correlations between the true grades and the predicted values YC grade, average r value  0.80  0.02, p-value 0.001 NC grade, average r value  0.73  0.02, p  0.001.

"Mechanisms of Arrhythmogenicity in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Insight from Noninvasive Electrocardiographic Imaging","Background Mechanisms of arrhythmogenicity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy HCM are not well understood. We hypothesized that HCM is characterized by the specific electrophysiological substrate as compared to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy ICM, or healthy individuals.Methods We conducted a prospective case-control study. The study enrolled HCM patients at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmia VT n10 age 619 y left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF 609, and three comparison groups healthy individuals n10 age 286 y LVEF70, ICM patients with LV hypertrophy LVH and known VT n10 age 649 y LVEF 3115, and ICM patients with LVH and no known VT n10 age 70  7y LVEF 4616.

"Violin plot data A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity classified using laboratory measured valve motion","ObjectivesWe hypothesize that prosthetic valve thrombogenic potential may be inferred by valve regional flow velocity. This metric was used to compare two clinical valves and two experimental prototypes. Methods Four our clinical and experimental prototype valve models were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. Regurgitant flow velocity was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate / projected dynamic valve area. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, thrombogenic potential for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as regurgitant flow velocities relative to the control mechanical valve regurgitant flow velocity of -126 m/s. Analysis of the flow velocity data made use of Vioplot R and VISIO software packages to provide split violin plots that represent probability of recurrence of data. Results Thrombogenic potential was made dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and 1.0. Negative thrombogenic potentials arise when transient rebound of valve occluder is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive thrombogenic potentials occur during decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest thrombogenic potential transient of 0.15. A mock-transcatheter aortic valve replacement incorporating by design a trivial paravalvular leak 1.35 ml/s demonstrated a high transient thrombogenic potential of 0.95. Conclusions Our data reveals distinct thrombogenic potential profile differences between valve models. If our study methods are verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to produce advanced devices with significantly reduced thrombogenic potential.","/content/10.1101/19009407v7","/content/10.1101/19009407v7.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","SCOTTEN","/highwire/citation/72630/bibtext",56,"270220-56","27/02/2020",72630
"Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation for refractory scar-related ventricular tachycardia","BackgroundStereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiotherapy that is performed in a single session and focuses high-dose ionizing radiation beams from a collimated radiation source to a small, localized area of the body. Recentl,y stereotactic radiosurgery has been applied to arrhythmias stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation - STAR, with promising results reported in patients with refractor,y scar-related ventricular tachycardia VT, a cohort with known high morbidity and mortality.ObjectiveHerein, we describe our experience with the use of CyberKnife, a frameless image-guided linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery system, in conjunction with CardioPlan, a cardiac specific radiotherapy planning software, to treat patients with scar-related VT, detailing its early and mid- to long-term results.MethodsThis is a pilot, prospective study of patients undergoing STAR for refractory VT. The anatomical target for radioablation was defined based on the clinical VT morpholog,y electroanatomical mapping, and study-specific pre-procedural imaging with cardiac computed tomography. The target volume delineated with the aid of CardioPlan was treated with a prescription radiation dose of 25 Gy delivered in a single fraction by CyberKnife in an outpatient setting. Ventricular arrhythmias and radiation-related adverse events were monitored at follow-up to determine STAR efficacy and safety.ResultFive patients 100  male, 63  12 years old, 80  ischemic cardiomyopath,y left ventricular ejection fraction 34  15  with refractory VT underwent STAR between January and June 2018. Radioablation was delivered in 82  11 minutes without acute complications. During a mean follow-up of 12  2 months, all patients experienced clinically significant mid- to late-term ventricular arrhythmia recurrence two patients died of complications associated with their advanced heart failure. There were no clinical or imaging evidence of radiation necrosis or other radiation-induced complications in the organs at risk surrounding the scar targeted by radioablation.ConclusionDespite good initial results, STAR did not result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in a selected, high-risk population of patients with scar-related VT. The safety profile was confirmed to be favorable, with no radiation-related complications observed during follow-up. Further studies are needed to explain these disappointing results.","/content/10.1101/19012880v2","/content/10.1101/19012880v2.full.pdf",20200225,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Gianni","/highwire/citation/72533/bibtext",4,"270220-4","27/02/2020",72533
"A Preoperative Estimate of Central Venous Pressure Is Associated with Early Fontan Failure","Objective Early Fontan Failure EFF is a serious complication following total cavopulmonary connection TCPC, characterised by high central venous pressure CVP, low cardiac output and resistance to medical therapy. This study aimed to estimate post-operative CVP in TCPC patients CVPTCPC using data routinely collected during pre-operative assessment. We sought to determine if this metric correlated with measured post-operative CVP and if it was associated with EFF.Methods In this retrospective stud,y CVPTCPC was estimated in 131 patients undergoing pre-TCPC assessment by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and CVP measurement under general anaesthesia. Post-operative CVP during the first 24hours in ICU was collected from electronic patient records in a subset of patients. EFF was defined as death, transplantation, TCPC takedown or emergency fenestration within the first 30days.ResultsEstimated CVPTCPC correlated significantly with CVPICU r0.26, p0.03, particularly in patients without a fenestration r0.45, p0.01. CVPTCPC was significantly associated with EFF Odds Ratio OR 1.12 1.02-1.24, p0.02.

"Cardiac Microstructural Abnormalities Identify Women at Risk of Incident Heart Failure","Background Incidence of congestive heart failure is difficult to predict by standard methods. We have developed a method called the signal intensity coefficient that uses echocardiographic texture analysis to quantify microstructural changes which may occur in at-risk patients prior to development of a clinical heart failure syndrome.Methods Participants from the Framingham Offspring Cohort study who attended the 8th visit and received screening echocardiography were included. Participants were followed for a mean of 7.4 years for incident congestive heart failure. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the hazard ratio of signal intensity coefficient in the top quartile of values versus other quartiles in the total and sex-stratified population.Results 2511 participants with interpretable echocardiography and no history of congestive heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction were included in this study. The top quartile signal intensity coefficient had a hazard ratio of 1.83 p0.0048 for incident heart failure. When additional clinical risk factors were added to the model, this became non-significant. Within women, an elevated hazard ratio was significant in multiple models including age and hypertensive medication use. Models were not significant in men.Conclusions Elevated signal intensity coefficient is associated with an increased risk of incident congestive heart failure. This trend remains significant in women after inclusion of age and hypertensive medication use. The signal intensity coefficient may be able to identify patients at risk of developing congestive heart failure using echocardiographic texture analysis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016477v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.20016477v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Kwan","/highwire/citation/71080/bibtext",24,"110120-24","11/01/2020",71080

"Feasibility of estimation of aortic wave intensity using non-invasive pressure recordings in the absence of flow velocity in man.","Background Wave intensity analysis provides valuable information on ventriculo-arterial function, hemodynamics and energy transfer in the arterial circulation. Widespread use of wave intensity analysis is limited by the need for concurrent measurement of pressure and flow waveforms. We describe a method that can estimate wave intensity patterns using only non-invasive pressure waveforms, and its reproducibility.Methods Radial artery pressure and left ventricular outflow tract LVOT flow velocity waveforms were recorded in 12 participants in the Southall and Brent Revisited SABRE study. Pressure waveforms were analysed using custom-written software to derive the excess pressure Pxs which was compared with the LVOT flow velocity waveform, and used to calculate wave intensity. In a separate stud,y repeat measures of wave intensity and other wave and reservoir parameters were performed on 34 individuals who attended 2 clinic visits at an interval of approximately 1 month to assess reproducibility and reliability of the method.Results Pxs waveforms were similar in shape to aortic flow velocity waveforms and the time of peak Pxs and maximum aortic velocity agreed closely mean difference  0.00 limits of agreement -0.02, 0.02s. Wave intensity patterns when scaled to peak LVOT velocity gave credible estimates of wave intensity similar to values reported previously in the literature. The method showed fair to good reproducibility for most parameters.Conclusions The Pxs is a surrogate of LVOT flow velocity allowing estimation of aortic wave intensity with acceptable reproducibility. This enables widespread application of wave intensity analysis to large studies.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018457v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018457v1.full.pdf",20200124,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Hughes","/highwire/citation/71376/bibtext",5,"250120-5","25/01/2020",71376
"A Pilot Study of an Esophageal Cooling Device During Radiofrequency Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation","Background Esophageal thermal injury is a risk of ablation of the posterior left atrium despite various devices utilized to date.  Objective Evaluate the potential of a commercially-available esophageal cooling device to provide esophageal protection during left atrial catheter ablation. Methods In this pilot stud,y we randomized 6 patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.  Three patients received standard of care for our site use of a single-sensor temperature probe, with adjunct iced-water instillation for any temperature increases 1C.  Three patients received standard ablation after placement of the esophageal cooling device using a circulating water temperature of 4C.  All patients underwent transesophageal echocardiogram TEE and esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD on the day prior to ablation followed by EGD on the day after. Results In the 3 control patients, one had no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, one had diffuse sloughing of the esophageal mucosa and multiple ulcerations, and one had a superficial ulcer with large clot.  Both patients with lesions were classified as Zargar 2a.  In the 3 patients treated with the cooling device, one had no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, one had esophageal erythema Zargar 1, and one had a solitary Zargar 2a lesion.  At 3-month follow-up, 1 patient in each group had recurrence of atrial fibrillation.Conclusions The extent of esophageal injury was less severe with a commercially available esophageal cooling device than with reactive instillation of ice-cold water. This pilot study supports further evaluation with a larger clinical trial.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20019026v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20019026v1.full.pdf",20200128,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Clark","/highwire/citation/71553/bibtext",6,"290120-6","29/01/2020",71553
"Evaluation of Myocardial Perfusion and Immune Cell Response in Cardiac Allograft Dysfunction of Heart-Transplant Patients","Background We investigated the myocardial perfusion differences and changes in immune cell response in heart-transplant patients with nonspecific graft dysfunction NGD compared to cardiac allograft vasculopathy CAV patients and normal heart-transplant patients.Methods and Results We prospectively studied 17 heart-transplant patients 59.8/-14.1 years, 78 male from January to June 2016. Regadenoson stress cardiac MRI was performed in the patients and peripheral blood obtained contemporaneously to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs. Stress myocardial perfusion showed significantly decreased myocardial perfusion using maximum upslope method in NGD and CAV patients compared to normal heart-transplant patients. Myocardial scar by late gadolinium enhancement also was significantly increased in nonspecific graft dysfunction patients compared to normal. Evaluation of PBMCs by flow cytometry showed a trend towards increased activated HLA-DR T cells in NGD patients compared to normal. Clinical outcomes for cardiac hospitalization, allograft loss/retransplant, death were assessed at 3 years.Conclusions NGD shows decreased stress myocardial perfusion by cardiac MRI and a trend towards increased activated T cells in PBMCs, suggestive of an immune-mediated cause for allograft dysfunction.Key Words cardiac allograft dysfunction stress myocardial perfusion cardiac allograft vasculopathy","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20018168v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20018168v1.full.pdf",20200130,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Kim","/highwire/citation/71633/bibtext",3,"310120-3","31/01/2020",71633
"Developing an Individualized Clinical Prediction Rules of Antihypertensive Drugs A Study Protocol Based on Real-world Practice","Background Hypertension is one of the most urgent public health challenges, and drug therapy is the primary method to control blood pressure for patients. However, blood pressure control rate is still poor with antihypertensive drugs use. Although Clinical Prediction Rules CPR is useful to help clinicians make more appropriate decisions at the point of medication, the evidence is still limited in china. The objective of this study is to develop an CPR of antihypertensive drugs in individualized application of patients based on real-world practice.Methods  A two-way cohort study has been conducted in one Chinas large tertiary hospital using clinical information on patient characteristics, drug use and clinical outcome. Data extraction is through ICD-10 disease codes of hypertension from Electronic Medical Record System. Eligible patients admitted from September 2016 to August 2018 who have received at least one antihypertensive drug therapy is included. Patients were grouped into several exposure groups according to medications. COX regression model and clinical specialty survey is applied to identify Influencing Factors IF in different study groups, and the discriminant model was used to construct a CPR according IF.

"Improving Esophageal Protection during AF ablation the IMPACT study.","Background Thermal injury to the esophagus is a known complication of ablation for atrial fibrillation AF and accounts for most procedure-related mortality. Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen by infusing cold liquid can reduce thermal injury to a limited extent. Objective To investigate the ability of a powerful temperature control device to protect the esophagus from ablation-related thermal injury.Methods A single-center, prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial was used to investigate the ability of the ensoETM device to protect the esophagus from thermal injury. This method was compared in a 11 randomization to a control group of standard practice utilizing a single-point temperature probe. In the study group, the device was used to keep the luminal temperature at 4 degrees during radiofrequency RF ablation for AF. Endoscopic examination was performed at 7 days post-ablation and esophageal injury was scored. The patient and the endoscopist were blinded to the randomization.Results We recruited 188 patients, of whom 120 underwent endoscopy. Thermal injury to the mucosa was significantly more common in the control group than in those receiving esophageal protection 12/60 versus 2/60 P0.008, with a trend toward reduction in gastroparesis 6/60 Vs 2/60, p0.27. There was no difference between groups in RF duration, force, power and combined ablation index P value range 0.2-0.9. Procedure duration and fluoroscopy duration were similar P0.97, P0.91 respectively. Conclusion Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen significantly reduces ablation-related thermal injury compared to standard care. This method of esophageal protection is safe and does not compromise the efficacy of the ablation procedure.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019158v2","/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019158v2.full.pdf",20200204,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Leung","/highwire/citation/71777/bibtext",18,"060220-18","06/02/2020",71777
"Quantification of positive family history as a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease","Objective There is very little research regarding quantification of family history as a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease. This is especially so in the South Asian population, which tends to suffer from ischaemic heart disease at a much younger age, even after environmental and dietary factors are accounted for. This indicates a likely genetic basis. The aim of this study was to quantify family history as a risk factor.Methods It is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Patients with family history and hypertension as the only cardiac risk factors were recruited in the study along with control subjects. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was used for the detection of myocardial ischemia.Results 114 patients had hypertension and family history as the only risk factors. 64 of these patients had myocardial ischemia. 102 control patients were also recruited, of whom only 26 suffered from myocardial ischemia. The odds-ratio was thus calculated to be 3.69 95 CI 1.54-9.28, p0.001.Conclusions These findings suggest a strong genetic basis for ischemic heart disease in the South Asian population.

"Fasting alters the gut microbiome with sustained blood pressure and body weight reduction in metabolic syndrome patients","Periods of fasting and refeeding may reduce cardiometabolic risk elevated by Western diet. We show that in hypertensive metabolic syndrome MetS patients n35, a 5-day fast followed by a modified DASH diet Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension reduced systolic blood pressure SBP, antihypertensive medication need, and body-mass index BMI at three months post intervention compared to a modified DASH diet alone n36. Fasting altered the gut microbiome, impacting bacterial taxa and gene modules associated with short-chain fatty acid production. Cross-system analyses revealed a positive correlation of circulating mucosa-associated invariant T MAIT cells, non-classical monocytes and CD4 effector T cells with SBP. Furthermore, regulatory T cells Tregs positively correlated with BMI and weight. Machine learning could predict sustained SBP-responsiveness within the fasting group from baseline immunome data, identifying CD8 effector T cells, Th17 cells and Tregs as important contributors to the model.

Methods In this retrospective, single-center stud,y 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 COVID-2019 patients including 2 deaths of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue EAT has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019.ResultsOf the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 4.88, 32 78.05, 4 9.75 and 3 7.32 patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 24.4 patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. Conclusion Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients.

"microRNA signatures of perioperative myocardial injury after elective non-cardiac surgery prospective observational cohort study","Background Elevated plasma/serum troponin, indicating perioperative myocardial injury PMI, is common after non-cardiac surgery. However, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Acute coronary syndrome ACS is associated with the early appearance of circulating microRNAs, which regulate post-translational gene expression. We hypothesised that if PMI and ACS share pathophysiological mechanisms, common microRNA signatures should be evident. Methods Nested case-control study of samples obtained before and after non-cardiac surgery from patients enrolled in two prospective observational studies of PMI postoperative troponin I/T99th centile. In cohort one, serum microRNAs were compared between patients with/without PMI, matched for age, gender and comorbidity.

"Polygenic Risk Score Modifies Risk of Coronary Artery Disease Conferred by Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol","An individuals lifetime risk of Coronary Artery Disease CAD is determined by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Whilst adherence to a healthy lifestyle can help individuals with high genetic risk reduce their lifetime risk of CAD, the extent to which blood lipid levels affect CAD risk in individuals with varying genetic risk remains unknown. To explore how genetics, blood lipids and CAD risk interact, we derived a novel genome-wide polygenic risk score PRS for CAD. We then applied the PRS to individuals from the UK Biobank and divided them into Low PRS bottom 10 percentiles of PRS distribution, Intermediate PRS PRS in the 10th-90th percentiles, and High PRS top 10 percentiles, and further stratified individuals by blood lipid levels.We found that the elevated CAD risk conferred by high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C was modified by the interaction with PRS P-value interaction 0.005. Individuals with High PRS and whose LDL-C was Borderline between 130 and 160 mg/dL had higher CAD relative risk HR 3.10 95 CI, 2.55-3.76 than those at Intermediate PRS whose LDL-C were Very High 190 mg/dL HR 2.77 95 CI, 2.33-3.28. Furthermore, individuals with High PRS but whose lipid levels were below the following thresholds did not have a significantly increased risk for incident CAD LDL-C 130 mg/dL, total Cholesterol TC 200 mg/dL, LDL-CHDL 2.0 and TCHDL 3.0. In addition, individuals with Low PRS and Very High LDL-C 190 mg/dl did not have increased CAD risk, which was comparable to individuals with Intermediate PRS and Optimal LDL-C 130 mg/dL.Our results have important implications for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease. Currentl,y healthy individuals with Borderline LDL-C 130-159 mg/dL are not considered to be at high risk of CAD. Here we demonstrate that the combination of Borderline LDL-C and High PRS results in CAD relative risk which is greater than individuals without high polygenic risk, but whose LDL-C levels are high enough for statins to be recommended 190 mg/dL. This analysis therefore demonstrates that PRS can identify a proportion of the population who are at high-risk of CAD but who are invisible to current approaches for assessing CAD risk. Moreover, of perhaps greater significance is the evidence that individuals who have a combination of High PRS and Optimal blood lipid levels do not have greater risk of CAD than individuals without high polygenic risk and the same Optimal blood lipid levels. Our results suggest that high polygenic risk for CAD could be overcome by controlling blood lipid levels. We propose that incorporating PRS into CAD risk assessment early in life could allow individuals at high polygenic risk to benefit from tailored blood lipid guidelines and avoid lifetime exposure to potentially damaging PRS-dependent LDL-C levels.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029454v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029454v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Bolli","/highwire/citation/73031/bibtext",41,"060320-41","06/03/2020",73031
"High Density Lipoprotein pathway as a therapeutic target for coronary heart disease individual participant meta-analysis in 28,597 individuals with 4197 coronary events","Importance Cholesterol content in high-density lipoprotein particles HDL-C is associated inversely with coronary heart disease CHD, but findings from Mendelian randomization studies and randomized trials of HDL-C raising drugs have questioned whether this link is causal.  However, these analyses do not exclude a causal role for specific HDL sub-fractions of different densit,y mobilit,y size and composition. Objective To determine whether sub-components of the HDL pathway exhibit differing relationships with CHD risk.Design In seven longitudinal studies, we used factor analysis to reduce 21 measures of HDL particle size and lipid content to a smaller number of factors representing different components of the HDL pathway. We constructed factor scores and modelled their associations on CHD risk in adjusted Cox regression analyses. We pooled results using random-effects meta-analysis.Setting Seven population-, individual-, occupational- or community-based longitudinal studies in the UK and Finland.Participants 28,597 participants 49 female, mean age 59.6 years contributed to the analysis.Exposures Sub-components of the HDL pathwa,y characterized by 21 measures of HDL size and lipid content based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Main Outcomes Incident fatal or non-fatal CHD.Results We identified 4 HDL components with highly replicable across studies 3 were indices of particle size/composition extra-large XL, large L and medium/small MS, and the other an index of triglycerides TG carried in HDL of all sizes. After up to 17 years of follow-up, 4179 incident CHD cases occurred.

"Prediction of Venous Thromboembolism Based on Clinical and Genetic Factors","BACKGROUND Both clinical and genetic factors drive the risk of venous thromboembolism. However, whether clinically recorded risk factors and genetic variants can be combined into a clinically applicable predictive score remains unknown. METHODS Using Cox proportional-hazard models, we analyzed the association of risk factors with the likelihood of venous thromboembolism in U.K. Biobank, a large prospective cohort. We created a novel ten point clinical score using seven established clinical risk factors for venous thromboembolism. We also generated a polygenic risk score of 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms to quantify genetic risk. The genetic score was categorized into high risk top two deciles of scores, intermediate risk deciles three to eight, and low risk lowest two deciles. The discrete clinical score led to the following approximate decile categorizations high risk 5 to 10 points, intermediate risk 3 to 4 points, and low risk 0 to 2 points. RESULTS Amongst the 502,536 participants in the U.K. Biobank, there were 4,843 events of venous thromboembolism. Analyses of established clinical risk factors and the most commonly used medications revealed that participants were at decreased risk of venous thromboembolism if they had ever used oral contraceptive pills hazard ratio, 0.88 95 confidence interval CI, 0.79 to 0.99 or if they currently used bendroflumethiazide hazard ratio, 0.84 95 CI, 0.74 to 0.95, cod liver oil capsules hazard ratio, 0.87 95 CI, 0.77 to 0.99, or atenolol hazard ratio, 0.79 95 CI, 0.68 to 0.91. Participants were at significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism if they were at high clinical risk hazard ratio, 5.98 95 CI, 5.43 to 6.59 or high genetic risk hazard ratio, 2.28 95 CI, 2.07 to 2.51 relative to participants at low clinical or genetic risk, respectively. Combining clinical risk factors with genetic risk factors produced a model that better predicted risk of venous thromboembolism than either model alone P0.001.  Participants at high clinical and genetic risk in the combined score had over an eightfold increased risk of venous thromboembolism relative to participants at low risk hazard ratio, 8.27 95 CI 7.59 to 9.00.CONCLUSIONS  By assessing venous thromboembolic events in over 500,000 participants, we identified several known and novel associations between risk factors and venous thromboembolism. Participants in the high risk group of a combined score, consisting of clinical and genetic factors, were over eight times more likely to experience venous thromboembolism than participants in the low risk group.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031054v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031054v1.full.pdf",20200306,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Kolin","/highwire/citation/73082/bibtext",58,"060320-58","06/03/2020",73082
"US Mortality Due To Congenital Heart Disease Across the Lifespan from 1999-2017 Exposes Persistent Racial/Ethnic Disparities","ABSTRACTBackgroundCongenital heart disease CHD accounts for approximately 40 percent of deaths in United States US children with birth defects. Previous US data from 1999-2006 demonstrated an overall decrease in CHD mortality. The objective of our study was to assess current trends in US mortality related to CHD from infancy to adulthood over the last 19 years and determine differences by sex and race/ethnicity.MethodsWe conducted an analysis of death certificates from 1999-2017 to calculate annual CHD mortality by age at death, race/ethnicit,y and se.x Population estimates used as denominators in mortality rate calculation for infants were based on National Center for Health Statistics live birth data. Mortality rates in individuals 1 year of age utilized US Census Bureau bridged-race estimates as denominators for population estimates. We characterized temporal trends in all-cause mortalit,y mortality resulting directly due to and related to CHD by age, race/ethnicit,y and sex using joinpoint regression.Results There were 47.7 million deaths with 1 in 814 deaths due to CHD n58,599. While all-cause mortality decreased 16.4 across all ages, mortality resulting from CHD declined 39.4 overall. The mean annual decrease in CHD mortality was 2.6, with the largest decrease for those age 65years. The age-adjusted mortality rate decreased from 1.37 to 0.83 per 100,000. Males had higher mortality due to CHD than females throughout the stud,y although both sexes declined at a similar rate 40 overall, with a 3-4 annual decrease between 1999 and 2009, followed by a slower annual decrease of 1.4 through 2017. Mortality resulting from CHD significantly declined among all race/ethnicities studied, although disparities in mortality persisted for non-Hispanic Blacks versus non-Hispanic Whites mean annual decrease 2.3 versus 2.6, respectively age-adjusted mortality rate 1.67 to 1.05 versus 1.35 to 0.80 per 100,000, respectively.Conclusions While overall US mortality due to CHD has decreased over the last 19 years, disparities in mortality persist for males compared to females and for non-Hispanic Blacks compared to non-Hispanic Whites.

In-hospital mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients are scarce.Objectives To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.Methods Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th Februar,y 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.Results A total of 110 patients with confirmed n80 or suspected n30 COVID-19 were screened and 48 patients female 31.3, mean age 70.5813.38 year old among them with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I hs-cTnI test within 48 hours after admission were included, of whom 17 17/48, 35.4 died in hospital while 31 31/48, 64.6 were discharged or transferred to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was levated in 13 13/48, 27.1 patents. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation SpO2 on admission HR 0.704, 95 CI 0.546-0.909, per 1 decrease, p0.007, elevated hs-cTnI HR 10.902, 95 1.279-92.927, p0.029 and elevated d-dimer HR 1.103, 95CI 1.034-1.176, per 1mg/L increase, p0.003 on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.Conclusions Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040121v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040121v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Cardiovascular Medicine","Zhang","/highwire/citation/74208/bibtext",203,"250320-203","25-03-2020",74208
